s2Member is a full-featured membership management system for WordPress®. It empowers WordPress® with membership capabilities, integrating seamlessly with PayPal®.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `/s2member` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress®.
1. Navigate to the `s2Member Options` panel for configuration details.

***Special instructions for WordPress® MU:** If you're installing this plugin on WordPress® MU, and you run a Blog Farm ( e.g. you give away free blogs to the public ), you should create a file in this plugin's directory, and name it: `wpmu.farm`. When this plugin is running under WordPress® MU, and that file ( `wpmu.farm` ) is present, the plugin will disable PHP code evaluation on data provided by the user, and it will tell the plugin to mutate itself ( including its menus ) for compatiblity with public Blog Farms. You don't need to do this unless you run a public Blog Farm. If you're running the standard version of WordPress®, or you run WordPress® MU to host your own sites, you can safely skip this step.*

***Security On WordPress® MU Blog Farms:** This plugin is currently released as NOT having compatiblity with MU Blog Farms. This is because s2Member provides a configuration panel for protected file downloads, and also a programming API that makes PHP Constants and other routines available to advanced users. For these reasons, it is not a good idea to make s2Member available for use within a public Blog Farm. That being said, if you want to use the `wpmu.farm` file & tweak the code a little, you might be able to tune things in. -- If you're running the standard version of WordPress®, or you run WordPress® MU to host your own sites, you can safely ignore this warning.*

== Description ==

s2Member is a full-featured membership management system for WordPress®. It provides a very tight integration with PayPal® Subscriptions, and fully supports recurring billing with the ability to track affiliate commissions on a recurring basis.

s2Member supports up to 4 different levels of membership with custom labels. It supports custom Pages for signup, account access, and many others. It also supports the ability to protect certain Pages, certain Posts, certain Categories/Tags, certain parts of content, and even includes advanced documentation on how to utilize the PHP runtime constants provided by the s2Member API. s2Member also supports protected file downloads with limitations on the how many files each user ( or each level ) can download in a given period of time.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the PayPal integration work right-out-of-the-box? =
Yes, it can even generate your PayPal® Subscription Buttons for you. Everything is fully integrated. You even get to create your own Pages within WordPress® to handle Membership Options, the Login Welcome Page, etc. For advanced webmasters, there are scripting techniques that are documented as well. These will help you further develop your site and tailor it to meet your specific needs. Advanced scripting is not required however.

= How many membership levels are supported? =
s2Member supports up to 4 membership levels, and you can label those levels anything you like. The defaults are Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum.

= Does s2Member utilize the PayPal IPN system? =
Yes, s2Member supports automation of account activation, welcome emails, renewals, de-activation, refunds, etc.

= Does s2Member install any new database tables? =
No, s2Member has been fully integrated with the Roles & Capabilities that are already built into WordPress®. It is designed to be completely seamless without code bloat.

= How does s2Member protect content from public access? =
s2Member allows you to protect Pages, Posts, and/or portions of content within Pages & Posts. It also allows you to protect downloadable files with special periodic restrictions on how many downloads can occur within a certain amount of time; on a per-user basis. All of this is configurable through the s2Member options panel. Each membership level can have different restrictions, and you could even integrate conditionals within your content based on the membership of the user. Examples are provided.

= Does s2Member provide an API that I can connect to? =
Yes, s2Member provides many *Advanced Scripting* techniques that are fully documented within its configuration and info pages. Example code is provided for everything. There are several functions that you can use, along with PHP Constants. This allows you to access many parts of its functionality, as well as specific user information. Theme designers are welcome to integrate their themes with s2Member using the code samples we provide.

= Is s2Member compatible with Quick Cache or WP Super Cache? =
Yes, there were some bugs in the beginning, but they have been fixed now. Both Quick Cache and WP Super Cache will remain compatible with s2Member. We have integrated two internal constants that prevent these plugins from caching important members only areas of your site, no matter what your cache configuration might be. The two Constants are: `DONOTCACHEPAGE` and `QUICK_CACHE_ALLOWED = false`. We recommend Quick Cache over WP Super Cache simply because we actually developed Quick Cache and we have done more extensive testing with the s2Member/Quick-Cache combination.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= Upgrading to v2.6 =
* ( This only applies if you're using s2Member to protect downloadable files. ) If you're upgrading from a previous version of s2Member, please take note that starting with s2Member v2.6, all of your security-enabled files should be placed into a directory outside the main plugin folder before you upgrade. The new directory is located inside `wp-content/plugins/s2member-files/`.

 This is a change from previous versions where the security-enabled directory was located inside the main plugin folder `wp-content/plugins/s2member/files/`. Moving your files outside the main plugin folder, and into the `wp-content/plugins/s2member-files` directory, will ensure that future upgrades performed through the WordPress® interface will not affect your protected file downloads.

== Changelog ==

= 2.6 =
* The security-enabled directory that protects downloadable files, has been moved outside the main plugin folder, and into a new directory `wp-content/plugins/s2member-files`. If you're using a previous version of s2Member to protect files inside the old directory `wp-content/plugins/s2member/files/`, you will need to move them into the new directory.

 s2Member will attempt to create this new directory for you automatically. However, if your `wp-content/plugins` directory is not writable, s2Member will fail silently, and you'll need to create that directory yourself. A warning will be displayed inside your WordPress® Dashboard, on the `Download Options` page if the security-enabled directory ( `s2member-files` ) is non-existent or unprotected. Instructions will be provided at that time about how to create this directory manually.

 It should also be noted... any of your existing links that use the `?s2member_file_download` variable will remain unaffected by this change. You can leave those links the way they are, just move your files into the new directory and you're good.
* The `File Download Options` page has been cleaned up a bit, and some additional instruction has been added to this configuration page.
* Enhanced logging routines for PayPal® IPN connections and sub-routines. Added PayPal® Return logging routines. Both of these logs can be turned on/off under `PayPal® Options`.
* Added some additional instructions to the `PayPal® Options` page, detailing step-by-step how to enable PayPal® IPN reporting, and optional Auto-Return w/ Payment Data Transfer.

= 2.5 =
* Bug fixed in PayPal® IPN routine. This bug was related to alias email addresses being paid through PayPal®, but then the primary (business) email address being returned in the IPN response. This bug was affecting some users who have multiple email addresses associated with a single PayPal® account. If they decided to use a non-Primary address with s2Member, it was causing a conflict. The validation routines have been corrected so that this is no longer an issue. One of the symptoms of this bug, was a simple Thank-you message after checkout, and a redirect to the login screen instead of to the registration page. Bug resolved.
* Another minor bug was found in the IPN routine. The IPN routine was not utilizing the `Email From Name` set in the `s2Member General Options`. A cleaning routine was completely losing the name field on one particular sub-routine associated with subscription signups. This bug has also been corrected.
* Files modified: `/functions/paypal-return.inc.php`, `/functions/paypal-notify.inc.php`, `/functions/email-hacks.inc.php` renamed to `email-configs.inc.php`.

= 2.4 =
* Fixed a bug in the PayPal® IPN and Auto-Return routines where it was possible for a conflict to arise whenever a subscription modification from one of these two routines jumped ahead of the other. This bug would have only affected site owners that were using the advanced `on0` and `os0` variables to allow members to upgrade from one membership level to another. This advanced technique is described in greater detail on the `Flow Of Events` page under `s2Member Options`.
* Applied the use of `add_query_arg()` ( a native WordPress® function ) to redirection after a successful signup. Some site owners reported problems with the `?action=register` parameter not being passed through correctly. The `add_query_arg()` function handles the `?` vs. `&` appendages more reliably.
* Added a fallback to the PayPal® IPN sub-routine for email receipts. By default, s2Member uses tinyURL.com to compress the longer URL into an email-friendly format. This new fallback will revert to using the longer version when/if tinyURL.com becomes temporarily unavailable for some reason.

= 2.3 =
* Fixed a bug related to compatiblity with `WP Super Cache` and the more modern `Quick Cache` plugin. We recommend `Quick Cache` because there has been more extensive testing performed with `Quick Cache`. That being said, s2Member should work fine with either of them installed. s2Member is compatible with both of these plugins. s2Member will prevent protected areas of your site from being cached by these plugins. To maximize compatiblity, please make sure that you're using friendly Permalinks; which is recommended anyway if you're using a caching plugin of any kind.
* Renamed `api-constants.inc.php` to just `constants.inc.php`.
* Renamed `nocache-headers.inc.php` to just `nocache.inc.php`.
* Modified `hooks.inc.php` to reflect these changes.

= 2.2 =
* Further optimized API routines that provide access to PHP Constants. Reduced queries from five down to just one.
* Fixed Tag Level Access issue; related to tag/slug conversion in the `General Options Panel`. This was not really a bug, but it was confusing to people, because tags were being converted to slugs automatically. This still happens internally, but they are no longer auto-converted within the `General Options Panel` because it was too confusing to site owners. If you are/were protecting certain tags, those tags will continue to be protected. This change will have NO impact on existing installations of s2Member.

= 2.1 =
* Re-organized core framework. Updated to: P-2.0.
* Updated to support WP 2.9+.

= 2.0 =
* Two new options were added for login screen customization. s2Member now supports the ability to modify the shadow and text colors too.
* A new internal filter was added to suppress systematic use pages; such as the Login Welcome Page and Download Limit Exceeded Page from search results. These pages are always protected anyway, but s2Member now filters them from on-site search listings as well, just to prevent them from popping up and causing confusion.
* Added some additional inline documentation for the option panels.
* Replaced deprecated `split()` function with `preg_split()`.

= 1.9 =
* Minor bug fixed in JavaScript API. Some constants were empty ( non-zero ) when downloads were disabled.
* Added some additional API Constants for Page IDs. These are intended to supplement the existing Page URLs.

= 1.8 =
* I broke the options panel down into smaller sub-sections because things were getting too crowded all on one page.
* A new API has been added that provides extended notifications for affiliate program integration and other back-office routines.
* Support for refunds and reversals ( e.g. charge backs ) has been added to the IPN integration making it 100% seamless now!
* Pixel Tracking has been added to support AdSense / Yahoo / Google Analytics and other tracking codes & marketing campaigns.
* Additional documentation has been added along side or beneath each option; which helps to further clarify any confusion.

= 1.7 =
* JavaScript prompts for (Protected File Download Confirmation) are now issued by s2Member in an intuitive way. Check your options panel under File Download Restrictions for notes on this topic.
* Added a new PHP Constant: `S2MEMBER_CURRENT_USER_DOWNLOADS_ALLOWED_IS_UNLIMITED`. Check the Advanced Scripting page in your Dashboard for further details.
* In the options panel, support was added for category level restrictions, tag level restrictions, and URI level restrictions.
* All of the PHP runtime Constants for advanced scripting have been made available through a new JavaScript API as well.
* Bug fix: `s2member_file_download` counters were counting the same file more than once. This has been corrected.

= 1.6 =
* Upgraded to fully support WP 2.8.4. Slight tweaks. Nothing major.
* Added a `Flow Of Events` page that provides additional documentation & explanations.
* Added optional support for PayPal Auto-Return with PDT ( Payment Data Transfer ).

= 1.5 =
* You can now customize the Login / Registration Pages with your bg & logo.
* Added support for affiliate program tracking with optional custom fields.
* Added support for recurring commission processing for affiliates.

= 1.4 =
* Added file download limitations, restrictions and .htaccess protection.
* Corrected a bug with 404 errors on files that were not available.
* Added support / compatibility for WP Super Cache & Quick Cache.

= 1.3 =
* Added full support for PayPal IPN scripting automation.
* Added additional documentation & code samples for advanced scripting.
* Added `s2member_xencrypt()` & `s2member_xdecrypt()` functions to the API.

= 1.2 =
* Added more code samples w/ PHP Constants for advanced scripting.
* Added support for custom labels on different membership levels.
* You can now customize the From: "Name" <address> used in emails.

= 1.1 =
* Updated to a more seamless integration with WP Roles & Capabilities.
* Added ways to easily protect Pages, Posts and conditional content.
* Advanced scripting now makes `current_user_can()` available.

= 1.0 =
* Initial release.
