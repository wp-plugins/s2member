s2Member is an extremely powerful ( and free ) membership management system for WordPress®. The s2Member Framework ( free ) integrates seamlessly with PayPal® ( very easy ), and fully supports recurring billing, with the ability to track affiliate commissions on a recurring basis. s2Member supports custom Pages for registration ( including Custom Registration Fields ), account access, and a whole lot more. s2Member is now compatible with Multisite Networking too, and even with BuddyPress if you like. In addition, with the s2Member Pro Module ( an optional paid upgrade ), you can add support for PayPal® Pro, Authorize.Net®, ccBill®, Google® Checkout, ClickBank®, and reach over 1 billion people in China with s2Member's AliPay® integration.

== Installation ==

= s2Member is very easy to install ( instructions ) =
1. Upload the `/s2member` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress®.
3. Navigate to the `s2Member Options` panel for configuration details.

= Auto-installing through WordPress® ( memory errors? ) =
This depends on your hosting provider and/or server configuration. Some web hosting companies impose very low limits on the amount of memory available to WordPress® during the execution of a single script. Since s2Member is a larger plugin, WordPress® may exceed conservative limits set forth by shared hosting companies. Don't feel bad, it's a very common problem. The solution is to install manually, using the instructions above. Memory limits only affect the WordPress® auto-installation routine, not the actual functionality of WordPress® or s2Member.

= Is s2Member compatible with WordPress® 3.0+ Multisite Networking ? =
Yes. s2Member v3.2+, and also s2Member Pro, are BOTH compatible with Multisite Networking enabled. After you enable Multisite Networking, install the s2Member plugin. Then navigate to `s2Member -> Multisite ( Config )` in the Dashboard on your ( Main Site ).

= What about Multisite Networking ( WPMU ), used on a Blog Farm? =
Yes, preliminary ( experimental ) support for Multisite Blog Farms has also been implemented. If you're running a Multisite Blog Farm ( i.e. you offer Blogs ), please contact s2Member.com for further details. With Multisite Networking enabled, your site could ALSO offer a Customer access to create a Blog of their own, where a Customer becomes a "Member" of your ( Main Site ), and also a Blog Owner/Administrator. With s2Member installed ( network wide ), each of your Blog Owners could offer Membership too, using a single installation of the s2Member plugin ( which is a great selling point ). We refer to this as a Multisite Blog Farm.

You can get started now, by turning on [Multisite Networking](http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network) inside your installation of WordPress®. Then, install the s2Member plugin ( network wide ). In the Dashboard for your Main Site, see: `s2Member -> Multisite ( Config )`. Before you go live, please contact [s2Member.com](http://www.s2member.com/contact/) for full documentation on Multisite Blog Farms. There is some additional functionality that can be enabled for security on a Blog Farm installation; and also some menus/documentation/functionality that can be disabled.

== Upgrading To The Latest Version ==

You can either (upgrade automatically) by going to `WordPress® -> Plugins` and clicking "upgrade automatically". If that fails with memory errors, you can upgrade manually by following these instructions:

1. Go to: `s2Member -> General Options -> Deactivation Safeguards`. Turn Safeguards `on`, click Save.
2. Now you can safely deactivate s2Member by going to `WordPress® -> Plugins -> s2Member`.
3. Login via FTP, and delete the entire `/wp-content/plugins/s2member` directory.
	You can leave `/plugins/s2member-logs/` and `/plugins/s2member-files/`.
4. Now upload the latest `/s2member` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`.
5. Go to: `WordPress® -> Plugins -> s2Member`, and reactivate.
6. That's it. All existing options will remain intact.

= Why do I get memory errors during automatic upgrade? =
This depends on your hosting provider and/or server configuration. Some web hosting companies impose very low limits on the amount of memory available to WordPress® during the execution of a single script. Since s2Member is a larger plugin, WordPress® may exceed conservative limits set forth by shared hosting companies. Don't feel bad, it's a very common problem. The solution is to upgrade manually. Memory limits only affect the WordPress® auto-installation/upgrade routine, not the actual functionality of WordPress® or s2Member.

== Description ==

s2Member is an extremely powerful ( and free ) membership management system for WordPress®. The s2Member Framework ( free ) integrates seamlessly with PayPal® ( very easy ), and fully supports recurring billing, with the ability to track affiliate commissions on a recurring basis. s2Member supports custom Pages for registration ( including Custom Registration Fields ), account access, and a whole lot more. s2Member is now compatible with Multisite Networking too, and even with BuddyPress if you like. In addition, with the s2Member Pro Module ( an optional paid upgrade ), you can add support for PayPal® Pro, Authorize.Net®, ccBill®, Google® Checkout, ClickBank®, and reach over 1 billion people in China with s2Member's AliPay® integration.

s2Member supports Free Subscribers ( at Level #0 ), and up to four Primary Membership Levels, [1-4]; plus unlimited Custom Capability Packages. Custom Capabilities allow you to create an unlimited number of Membership Packages, all with different Capabilities and prices. You can label your Membership Levels anything you like. The defaults are Free, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum.

s2Member allows you to protect Pages, Posts, Tags, Categories, URIs, URI word fragments, URI Replacement Codes for BuddyPress, Specific Post/Page "Buy Now" Access, and even portions of content within Posts/Pages/themes/plugins. Everything is configurable through the s2Member Options Panel. This makes s2Member VERY easy to integrate into any WordPress®-powered site. With s2Member, you can also protect downloadable files, using special restrictions on how many downloads can occur within a certain amount of time; all based on Membership Level.

Each Membership Level can have different restrictions, and you could even integrate Conditionals within your content based on Member Level, or on Custom Capabilities. Both Simple ( Shortcode ) and Advanced ( PHP ) code samples are provided under `s2Member -> API Scripting`. s2Member has been fully integrated with Roles &amp; Capabilities that are already built into WordPress®. No new tables :-) It is designed to be completely seamless, without code bloat. We've carefully structured the entire framework, in order to maximize s2Member's ability to operate with other plugins installed.

You can also sell Specific Post/Page Access ( membership not required ), using "Buy Now" buttons. You can even package multiple Posts/Pages together into one "Buy Now" transaction. Further details are provided under `s2Member -> PayPal® Buttons -> Specific Posts/Pages`.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there documentation available for s2Member? =
Yes. You will need to install s2Member. The official documentation is built right into the plugin's configuration panels. Supplemental documentation is also built into the plugin, found in your Dashboard under: `s2Member -> API / Scripting` ( which covers MANY advanced topics ).

= Are video tutorials available for s2Member? =
Yes. [Video Tutorials](http://www.s2member.com/videos/) for s2Member are available [here](http://www.s2member.com/videos/).

= Is there a community forum for s2Member? =
Yes. The [Forum](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=4) for s2Member is available [here](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=4).

= Where can I download older versions of s2Member? =
Archived releases of s2Member are maintained [here](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/s2member/download/).

= Does s2Member install any new database tables? =
No, s2Member has been fully integrated with the Roles &amp; Capabilities that are already built into WordPress®. It is designed to be completely seamless, without code bloat. We've carefully structured the entire framework, in order to maximize s2Member's ability to operate with other plugins installed. For instance, s2Member is also compatible with BuddyPress.

= Does PayPal integration work right-out-of-the-box? =
Yes, it can even generate your PayPal® Subscription Buttons for you. Everything is fully integrated. You even get to create your own Pages within WordPress® to handle Membership Options, the Login Welcome Page, etc. For advanced webmasters, there are scripting techniques that are documented as well. These will help you further develop your site and tailor it to meet your specific needs. s2Member API Scripting is NOT required however.

= How many Membership Levels are supported? =
s2Member supports Free Subscribers ( at Level #0 ), and up to four Primary Membership Levels [1-4]; plus unlimited Custom Capability packages. Custom Capabilities allow you to create an unlimited number of Membership Packages, all with different Capabilities and prices. You can label your Membership Levels anything you like. The defaults are Free, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum. s2Member also makes it possible to sell an unlimited number of Specific Post/Page Access Links using "Buy Now" buttons. Further details are provided under `s2Member -> PayPal® Buttons -> Specific Posts/Pages`.

= Does s2Member utilize the PayPal® IPN system? =
Yes, s2Member supports automation of account activation, welcome emails, confirmations, renewals, de-activation, refunds, etc. The integration with PayPal® is seamless. s2Member even provides API Notifications, which are an added layer of functionality. These are not to be confused with the IPN service. s2Member API Notifications make it easier to integrate back-office routines, affiliate programs, list servers, or any other 3rd-party applications that should react to certain events.

= Does s2Member support PayPal® PDT/Auto-Return? =
Yes, s2Member will work with PayPal® Auto-Return/PDT (Payment Data Transfer) `On`, and also with Auto-Return/PDT `Off`. If you enable Auto-Return, you MUST also enable PDT and supply s2Member with your Identity Token. If one is enabled, the other must also be enabled; and vice-versa. There is a place to enter your PayPal® Identity Token for PDT under `s2Member -> PayPal® Options`.

= Can I use PayPal® Pro, Authorize.Net®, ccBill®, AliPay®, ClickBank®, Google® Checkout? =
Yes. [s2Member Pro](http://www.s2member.com/) is an add-on module for the free version of s2Member. [s2Member Pro](http://www.s2member.com/) adds [PayPal® Pro integration](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=304), a PayPal® Pro Form Generator, Authorize.Net® integration, ccBill® integration, Google® Checkout integration, ClickBank® integration, AliPay® integration, advanced User Import/Export tools, support for Coupon Codes, and more. Your purchase of s2Member Pro includes free lifetime upgrades; along with full access to our [video tutorial library](http://www.s2member.com/videos/).

= How does s2Member protect content from public access? =
s2Member allows you to protect Pages, Posts, Tags, Categories, URIs, URI word fragments, URI Replacement Codes for BuddyPress, Specific Post/Page Access ( Buy Now! ), and even portions of content within Posts/Pages/themes/plugins using Simple ( Shortcode ) or Advanced ( PHP ) Conditionals. Everything is configurable through the s2Member Options Panel. This makes s2Member VERY easy to integrate into any WordPress®-powered site. With s2Member, you can also protect downloadable files, using special restrictions on how many downloads can occur within a certain amount of time. Each Membership Level can have different restrictions ( even Custom Capability Packages ). You can also integrate Conditionals within your content based on Capabilities. Both Simple and Advanced code samples are provided under `s2Member -> API Scripting`.

= Does s2Member support an account approval process? =
s2Member does not come with an approval system. That being said, what many site owners do, is they allow Free Registration ( i.e. Open Registration: `on` ). This allows visitors to register for free at Level #0, which just gives them an account. After a manual review of Level #0 accounts, an Administrator can upgrade them to Level #1 or higher; granting them access to content you've protected at those higher Levels. So the trick is to protect your content at Level #1 or higher, then allow Open Registration at Level #0. In other words, Level #0 Members will just have an account, but not actually have access to anything until you increase their Membership Level from the default Level #0. If you would like to display a custom message ( i.e. "Your account is pending review." ), you can use s2Member's Simple Conditionals to detect a Customer's Membership Level, and to display an appropriate message on your Login Welcome Page. For further details on Simple/Advanced Conditionals, please check your Dashboard under `s2Member -> API Scripting -> Simple/Advanced Conditionals`.

= Does s2Member provide an API that I can connect to? =
Yes, s2Member provides many *Advanced Scripting* techniques that are fully documented within its Option Panels. Code samples are provided for everything. There are several API functions that you can use, along with s2Member API Constants. This allows you to access many parts of its functionality, as well as specific Member information. Theme designers are welcome to integrate their themes/plugins with s2Member using the code samples that we provide under `s2Member -> API Scripting`. s2Member even provides API Notifications, which are an added layer of functionality. These are not to be confused with the IPN service. s2Member API Notifications make it easier to integrate back-office routines, affiliate programs, list servers, or any other 3rd-party application that should react to certain events.

= Is s2Member compatible with Quick Cache or WP Super Cache? =
Yes, there were some bugs in the beginning, but they have been fixed now. Both Quick Cache and WP Super Cache will remain compatible with s2Member. We have integrated two internal Constants that prevent these plugins from caching important Members Only areas of your site, no matter what your cache configuration might be. The two Constants are: `DONOTCACHEPAGE` and `QUICK_CACHE_ALLOWED = false`. We recommend Quick Cache over WP Super Cache though; simply because we actually developed Quick Cache, and we've done more extensive testing with the s2Member/Quick-Cache combination.

= Is s2Member compatible with WordPress® 3.0+ Multisite Networking ? =
Yes. s2Member v3.2+, and also s2Member Pro, are BOTH compatible with Multisite Networking enabled. After you enable Multisite Networking, install the s2Member plugin. Then navigate to `s2Member -> Multisite ( Config )` in the Dashboard on your ( Main Site ).

= What about Multisite Networking ( WPMU ), used on a Blog Farm? =
Yes, preliminary ( experimental ) support for Multisite Blog Farms has also been implemented. If you're running a Multisite Blog Farm ( i.e. you offer Blogs ), please contact s2Member.com for further details. With Multisite Networking enabled, your site could ALSO offer a Customer access to create a Blog of their own, where a Customer becomes a "Member" of your ( Main Site ), and also a Blog Owner/Administrator. With s2Member installed ( network wide ), each of your Blog Owners could offer Membership too, using a single installation of the s2Member plugin ( which is a great selling point! ). We refer to this as a Multisite Blog Farm.

You can get started now, by turning on [Multisite Networking](http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network) inside your installation of WordPress®. Then, install the s2Member plugin ( network wide ). In the Dashboard for your Main Site, see: `s2Member -> Multisite ( Config )`. Before you go live, please contact [s2Member.com](http://www.s2member.com/contact/) for full documentation on Multisite Blog Farms. There is some additional functionality that can be enabled for security on a Blog Farm installation; and also some menus/documentation/functionality that can be disabled. NOTE ~ You will be asked to make a donation, or to purchase a Support Package for s2Member.

= Is s2Member compatible with the BuddyPress plugin for WordPress? =
Yes it is. In fact, we must say... the s2Member/BuddyPress combination is just awesome. These two plugins running together make all sorts of things possible.

= How does s2Member know when to demote a paid Member to a Free Subscriber? =
s2Member uses its built-in Auto-EOT System ( new ). EOT = End Of Term. Whenever you generate a PayPal® Button with s2Member, you'll configure a length for the Subscription. Depending on the type of Subscription you choose ( recurring, non-recurring, lifetime, or fixed-term ); s2Member will either use PayPal's IPN/`subscr_payment,subscr_cancel,subscr_eot` notices, or it will set an Automatic EOT Time, which is processed automatically by s2Member via WP_Cron. For each Member, you can also override the EOT Time, by forcing a specific expiration date. To manually adjust the EOT Time for a specific Member, go to: `WordPress® -> Users`, and click the Edit link next the Member you want to work on.

= Do I need the s2Clean Theme? =
No. Both s2Member ( the [free version](http://www.primothemes.com/post/product/s2member-membership-plugin-with-paypal/) ), as well as the [s2Member Pro Module](http://www.s2member.com/prices/) will work in just about ANY WordPress® theme. That being said, if you're starting a brand new site, we DO suggest the [s2Clean Theme](http://www.primothemes.com/post/product/s2clean-theme-for-wordpress/), because it has already been setup specifically for s2Member, which will cut down on your development time. For example, the s2Clean Theme comes with a login box built into the site, and it also comes with pre-built Page Templates for s2Member's Login Welcome Page. You could create both of these inside WordPress® using any theme, even without Templates; but the s2Clean Theme makes it all much easier to work with.

= Why do I get memory errors during installation and/or upgrade? =
This depends on your hosting provider and/or server configuration. Some web hosting companies impose very low limits on the amount of memory available to WordPress® during the execution of a single script. Since s2Member is a larger plugin, WordPress® may exceed conservative limits set forth by shared hosting companies. Don't feel bad, it's a very common problem. The solution is to upgrade manually. Memory limits only affect the WordPress® auto-installation/upgrade routine, not the actual functionality of WordPress® or s2Member.

= How can I see more of what's going on behind-the-scene? =
s2Member comes with two very sophisticated logging systems. One for its PayPal® IPN communications ( and resulting actions ). The other logs Return-Data processing. You can enable them both, by going to: `s2Member -> PayPal® Options -> Account Details -> Logging`.

= When a User/Member is demoted by the Auto-EOT System, are Custom Capabilities removed too? =
Yes, whenever a User/Member is demoted, s2Member resets their account back to a Free Subscriber. Any Custom Capabilities the User/Member had - will be removed; as they should be.

= Is the free version of s2Member still being supported by WebSharks, Inc? =
Yes, without a doubt. The free version of s2Member ( aka: the s2Member Framework ), is the foundation on which the s2Member Pro Module, and future development will occur.

= s2Member does this, but I want it to do that. Is that possible? =
We get this type of question a lot. The answer is most definitely **yes**. The entire s2Member Framework is extremely versatile. For instance, the s2Member Pro Module is built on top of the free s2Member Framework; on top of the worlds' most powerful publishing platform ( WordPress® ). That being said, you WILL need be familiar with PHP, and/or WordPress® Hooks/Filters in order to accomplish advanced customizations. We suggest hiring a freelance developer at Elance.com, or hiring Jason Caldwell ( our own Lead Developer ) @ PriMoThemes.com / WebSharks, Inc. [Jason Caldwell](http://www.primothemes.com/post/author/websharksinc-jason/) is the Lead Developer behind the s2Member plugin, and also the s2Member Pro Module.

= Can s2Member implement a Captcha Code on my Login/Registration Forms? =
No. We've left this feature out of the plugin intentionally. Many site owners prefer to use Captcha plugins that encompass all aspects of their site ( including comment forms ). We recommend this one: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/si-captcha-for-wordpress/ . That being said, if you're running [s2Member Pro](http://www.s2member.com/), you can. s2Member's Pro Forms for PayPal® Pro and Authorize.Net® ( including Free Registration Forms ) CAN be configured to use Google's reCAPTCHA service ( which is free ). Just add this Attribute to your Pro Form Shortcode ( `captcha="1"` ).

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 3.5+ =
* Upgrade highly recommended. Many new features, WordPress® 3.1 compatible, speed optimizations, and several bug fixes.

== Changelog ==

= 3.5 =
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). WordPress® 3.1.** Updated for full compatibility with WordPress® 3.1 ( s2Member also remains compatible with the WordPress® 3.0.x series ).
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). Speed Optimizations.** s2Member's entire codebase has been re-organized into PHP classes containing s2Member's static functions ( dev note: all of s2Member's Hooks/Filters remain as they were ). This new infrastructure allows s2Member to take full advantage of PHP's built-in [SPL Autoload](http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.autoload.php) extension. This means s2Member's source code is loaded ( only on-demand ) as function calls are made within core routines. So instead of loading s2Member's entire codebase into WordPress®; only the objects/methods needed during the processing of particular page will be included. Long story short, this release of s2Member is much faster than previous versions. For advanced site owners, this will make it more feasible to run s2Member in concert many other plugins; even on shared hosting.
* **(s2Member). New feature.** You can now force WordPress® to use your Membership Labels instead of referencing them by s2Member Level #. For further details on this topic, check your Dashboard under `s2Member -> General Options -> Membership Levels/Labels`.
* **(s2Member). Profile Shortcode.** s2Member now provides a built-in Shortcode ( `[s2Member-Profile /]` ) that generates an inline Profile Modification Form; which can be inserted into any Post/Page ( such as your Login Welcome Page ) or even into a Text Widget if you like. This feature is ( in addition to ) the existing `/?s2member_profile=1` stand-alone version that has always been available with s2Member.
* **(s2Member). New feature.** s2Member now supports Remote Header Authorization on File Downloads ( optional ). Remote Header Authorization allows access to file downloads through an entirely different approach ( again, using this is 100% optional ). Instead of asking the Member to log into your site through a browser, a Member can be prompted automatically, to log in through HTTP Header Authorization prompts; which is the same technique used in more traditional security systems via .htaccess files. In other words, Remote Header Authorization makes it possible for your Members to access files through remote applications that may NOT use a browser. This is often the case when a Member needs to access protected files through a software client like iTunes®; typical with podcasts. For further details, please check your Dashboard under `s2Member -> Download Options -> Remote Auth / Podcasting`.
* **(s2Member). New feature.** s2Member now supports a new option in its Login/Registration Design panel. If you have WordPress® 3.1+ installed, you can add your own raw HTML/PHP code to the very bottom of your default Login/Registration Forms with s2Member. Please check your Dashboard under: `s2Member -> General Options -> Login/Registration Design`.
* **(s2Member). New feature.** You can now tell s2Member to *encrypt* your PayPal® Buttons automatically for added security. When this feature is enabled, all of your PayPal® Button Shortcodes will produce *encrypted* PayPal® Buttons. This improves security against fraudulent transactions. To turn this feature on, please log into your Dashboard and navigate to `s2Member -> PayPal® Options -> Account Details`. You'll need to provide s2Member with your PayPal® API Username/Password/Signature; and then enable `Button Encryption`. Additional instructions are provided in your WordPress® Dashboard. NOTE: This feature does NOT require you to have a PayPal® Pro account. If you do, that's fine, but it's not a requirement. Also, this particular feature is ONLY applicable to PayPal® Buttons ( it does NOT work with Pro Forms, nor does it need to ).
* **(s2Member Pro). CSV Exportation.** s2Member now provides two different export formats. 1. Default CSV ( for easy re-importation ). 2. Easy-Read CSV ( improved readability; CANNOT be re-imported ). In addition to these new options, ALL CSV export formats now include column headers too. This makes CSV files easier to read inside applications like MS Excel or OpenOffice/Calc.
* **(s2Member Pro). Authorize.Net®.** s2Member Pro now provides support for Authorize.Net® integrations. Authorize.Net® is a leading provider of payment gateway services, managing the submission of billions of transactions to processing networks on behalf of merchant customers. Authorize.Net is a solution offered by the CyberSource Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Visa (NYSE: V).
* **(s2Member Pro). ccBill®.** s2Member Pro now provides support for ccBill® integration. ccBill® is a great choice when you need to process transactions discreetly on an adult-oriented site. Drawing on its years of experience and proven payment processing platform, ccBill® has a solution that will not only meet the requirements of your consumers, it will also help address the specific needs of your business.
* **(s2Member Pro). New feature.** s2Member now allows for the inclusion of the Pro Login Widget directly into a theme/plugin file ( optional ). Example usage: `<?php echo s2member_pro_login_widget(); ?>`. It is also possible to configure widget options dynamically. For further details, please check the documentation inside this file: `/s2member-pro/includes/functions/api-functions.inc.php`.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). Optimization.** If/when s2Member's logging/debugging mechanisms are enabled through the Dashboard, s2Member is now capable of archiving its own log files. Oversize log files ( i.e. larger than 2MB ) are automatically renamed with `...-ARCHIVED-{time}.log` to prevent s2Member from creating ridiculously large log files that may have otherwise built up over a longer period of time.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). New Profile field.** A new drop-down menu has been added to the administration editing panel for User/Member Profiles. This new drop-down menu allows a site owner to specify which Payment Gateway a Member's payments are associated with. s2Member will automatically configure this field for you, but it is editable none the less. NOTE: If you are upgrading from a previous version of s2Member, you may notice that s2Member will NOT have this information on file for any existing Members that you obtained prior to installing s2Member v3.5+. You may want to go through and update the value of this field for each Member after upgrading. That being said, this new field is only provided for clarity; and for future compatibility. In other words, there is no functionality lost if the Payment Gateway field is left blank for previously existing Members.
* **(s2Member). New feature.** s2Member now supports a new Replacement Code for Login Redirection URLs, and also for URI Restrictions ( `%%current_user_ccaps%%` ). This is the current User's set of Custom Capabilities. If the current User has multiple Custom Capabilities, they will be separated by hyphens; allowing this string to be used in the formulation of slugs for a Special Login Redirection URL; which could be configured differently for each Custom Capability Package that you offer.
* **(s2Member). New feature.** s2Member can now automate un-subscribe/opt-out removals for any List Servers that you've integrated ( i.e. MailChimp®, AWeber® ). s2Member is also capable of handling everything based on your own personal configuration preferences. You can choose which Events you consider grounds for List Removal. For further details, please check your Dashboard under: `s2Member -> API / List Servers -> Automate Un-Subscribes`. During a paid Subscription Modification, it also possible to have Members un-subscribed from Lists at their existing Membership Level#, while at the same time; subscribing them to Lists you've configured at the Membership Level they are upgrading/downgrading to.
* **(s2Member). New feature.** Brute Force IP/Login Restrictions. As with any Membership system, it is possible for someone to try and guess Username/Password combinations by attempting a Brute Force Attack; whereby multiple/repeated logins are strategically attempted with various Username/Password combinations until a correct guess is made. It is NOT likely that you'll be attacked in this way, but it's still a good idea to protect your system; just in case somebody tries this. s2Member thwarts this behavior by monitoring failed login attempts that occur within a short period of time. Whenever s2Member detects an IP address ( i.e. a remote user ) that is consistently failing to enter a valid Username/Password, a temporary ban is created; preventing additional attempts from taking place for 30 minutes. This temporary ban, will ONLY affect the offending IP address. For further details and configuration of this new feature, please check your Dashboard under: `s2Member -> General Options -> Brute Force IP/Login Restrictions`.
* **(s2Member Pro). New feature.** The s2Member (Pro) Login Widget now includes Login/Logout Redirection options. For further details, please check your Dashboard under: `Appearance -> Widgets -> s2Member (Pro) Login Widget`.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). Compatibility.** s2Member now precedes all of its calls to these two functions with an @ sign ( `@ini_get` and `@ini_set` ). This suppresses errors generated by PHP whenever these functions are disabled on the installation server. This is a very minor issue, as most hosting companies DO allow these functions to be called through PHP. At any rate, the preceding @ sign now puts s2Member inline with WordPress® standards in this regard.
* **(s2Member). WP 3.1 Compatibility.** When "Redirect Members away from the Default Profile Panel?" is set to ( <code>Yes</code> ), s2Member will take an initiative to further safeguard ALL <code>/wp-admin/</code> areas of your installation; not just the Default Profile Panel. Also, starting with WordPress® 3.1+, setting this to ( <code>Yes</code> ) tells s2Member to dynamically modify links/titles in the new Admin Bar that can be enabled on WordPress® 3.1+. s2Member will force links to your Login Welcome Page instead of the Default Profile Panel; and Dashboard links are removed for non-Admin accounts ( as they should be ).
* **(s2Member). New feature.** It is now possible to delete/reset IP Restrictions ( i.e. temporary bans ) caused by a security breach in your configuration of s2Member's IP Restrictions. Some site owners have reported complaints from their Customers about the error `503 / Too Many IP Addresses`. This is not a bug; it is the result of a temporary ban that s2Member imposes automatically; based on your IP Restriction configuration in the General Options panel for s2Member. Improving upon this functionality in s2Member v3.5+, you can now pull up a Users account in your Dashboard and delete/reset temporary bans on a per-User basis; as needed for customer service. For further details, or to delete/reset ALL IP Restrictions at once, please check your Dashboard under: `s2Member -> General Options -> IP Restrictions`.
* **(s2Member). Multisite bug fix.** When s2Member is installed on a Multisite Network, it is now capable of dealing with centralized Users accounts that are being shared across multiple sites in the Network. In other words, s2Member v3.5+ prevents WordPress® from generating `username/email exists` errors through front-end forms whenever a User that exists on one site attempts to register on another. In order to accomplish this, s2Member v3.5 introduces one additional Multisite patch for your `/wp-includes/ms-functions.php` file, making it possible for WordPress® to add/remove existing User accounts from one site to another (gracefully); just like that which is supported natively in the WordPress® Dashboard already. NOTE: after updating to s2Member v3.5+, please be sure to re-run your Multisite (Config) patches. You will find these patches in your Dashboard under: `s2Member -> Multisite (Config)`. And yes, this is also compatible with WordPress® v3.1.
* **(s2Member). Multisite auto-patcher.** When running on a Multisite Network with `Automatically Patch WordPress® = yes`, s2Member is now capable of hooking into the automatic upgrade routines for WordPress® so that future updates to the WordPress® core framework will remain synchronized with core patches required by s2Member ( and a notice regarding patches automatically synchronized will be displayed during the core upgrade routine in your Dashboard ). This is ONLY applicable if you're running s2Member on a Multisite Network. For further details, check your Dashboard under: `s2Member -> Multisite (Config)`.
* **(s2Member Pro). Multisite Blog Farms.** On a Multisite Blog Farm, it is now possible for child Blog Administrators running s2Member Pro to utilize the advanced Import/Export routines provided by the s2Member Pro module.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). New feature.** It is now possible to (ADD) Custom Capabilities through a Subscription Modification Button/Form. By default, a Checkout Button or Form generated by s2Member is designed to set and/or reset a Member's Custom Capabilities to the ones you specify in the Button/Form Code. However, starting with s2Member v3.5+, you can tell s2Member to (ADD) additional Custom Capabilities to any that already exist for a particular Member. This is accomplished on a per Form/Button basis by preceding your comma-delimited list of Custom Capabilities with a (+) sign. For further details on this topic, click the [?] icon next to the Custom Capabilities field in any Button/Form Generator supplied by s2Member.
* **(s2Member). Compatibility.** s2Member's data encryption routines have always used a URL-safe version of Base64 Encoding to transfer data; whereby the Base64 padding character `=` is replaced with a URL-safe `.`. This routine has been modified to replace `=` with `~` instead of `.`; making s2Member more compatible with internal WordPress® functions like `site_url()` which refuse to generate URLs containing double `..` occurrences. Backward compatibility for existing data remains intact though; so this change only serves to improve s2Member's compatibility with WordPress®.
* **(s2Member). New cookie.** s2Member has always used three temporary/encrypted cookies to authenticate a newly paid Customer. Starting with s2Member v3.5, there are now four cookies all together ( `s2member_subscr_gateway`, `s2member_subscr_id`, `s2member_custom`, `s2member_level` ). The new addition is `s2member_subscr_gateway`. The value of this cookie is also stored internally; it's associated with a Customer's Paid Subscr. ID. You can edit the Paid Subscr. Gateway/ID if you'd like. You'll find a drop-down menu on the [Edit] page for each Member.
* **(s2Member). Bug fix.** The built-in Profile Editing panel for s2Member that resides at `/?s2member_profile=1` contained an extra ( i.e. double ) closing tag for the `form` element. This has been corrected in s2Member v3.5+.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). New feature.** s2Member's Button and Form Generators now provide a customer service tool that allows a site owner to generate Membership Registration Access Links on their own ( if/when needed ). This tool accompanies the Specific Post/Page Link Generation tool that has been a part of previous versions of s2Member. So these tools working together, now make it possible to create Access Links for both types of functionality. Again, these tools are provided for convenience. They are only intended to help site owners with customer service issues; they are NOT a required aspect of s2Member's integration with WordPress®.
* **(s2Member Pro). Bug fix.** A Pro Form configuration error, `Invalid "rp, rt" attributes.`, was being triggered whenever the Pro Form Attribute `rp` was greater than 1 year; even for Buy Now (BN) transactions. This was NOT the intended behavior, as the 1 year recurring limitation applies only to PayPal® Recurring Profiles, and should NOT have been limiting Buy Now transactions under 5 years. This bug/limitation has been resolved in the latest release. Maximum Subscription length for PayPal® Pro Recurring Profiles is 1 year, and maximum Subscription length for Buy Now transactions is 5 years; or 1 Lifetime also being possible.
* **(s2Member Pro). Bug fix.** A Pro Form configuration error, `attribute is "D", and "tp" ( Trial Period ) > 7` was corrected. This should have been testing for 365 days instead of 7.
* **(s2Member Pro). Bug fix.** The AliPay® integration file `alipay-notify.inc.php` was updated to correct an incompatibility issue with AliPay® custom variables. A symptom of this bug was ( no email being received after AliPay® checkout ). This bug has been resolved in s2Member Pro v1.5.
* **(s2Member Pro). Bug fix.** The AliPay® integration file `alipay-notify.inc.php` was not exiting with the proper `success` status in its communication with AliPay®. A symptom of this bug was repeated notifications for a single transaction; thereby causing multiple emails to each Customer under the right circumstance. This bug has been resolved in s2Member Pro v1.5.
* **(s2Member Pro). New feature.** If you're using Pro Forms with s2Member Pro; particularly if you run a Multisite Blog Farm, you can now set this Constant in your `/wp-config.php` file: `define('S2MEMBER_PRO_AUTO_FORCE_SSL', true);`. This tells s2Member Pro to auto-force SSL on any Post/Page that contains a Pro Form Shortcode. This is useful if you're running a Blog Farm and SSL is already provided/configured for all Site Owners on your Network. Otherwise, the method of using a WordPress® Custom Field `s2member_force_ssl = yes` on a per-Post/Page basis works fine.
* **(s2Member Pro). Bug fix.** s2Member Pro was sometimes processing API Payment Notifications in duplicate for AliPay®, ClickBank®, ccBill®, and Google® Checkout integrations. This has been resolved in s2Member Pro v1.5+.
* **(s2Member Pro). Bug fix.** s2Member Pro was sometimes delivering ClickBank® Customers to a Return-Page with a default POST vars error because of an invalid `proxy_use / ty-email` specification. This has been resolved in s2Member Pro v1.5+.
* **(s2Member Pro). Bug fix.** s2Member Pro Form integration with PayPal's Pro API, was suffering from a minor glitch caused by date/time conflicts between the s2Member installation server ( i.e. your server ) and PayPal's API server. In some rare cases, s2Member was attempting to start new Recurring Profiles in the past ( at least in the eyes of the PayPal® API server ); which could be in a different time zone. s2Member Pro now avoids this potential conflict by padding start dates with 12 hour offsets; making s2Member more reliable in this regard.
* **(s2Member Pro). Desc attribute change.** The maximum characters allowed in the `desc=""` attribute for Pro Form Shortcodes ( and only for Pro Forms ) is now `100` characters. In previous versions the max length was `127`. This has been lowered to `100` so that s2Member has plenty of room for dynamically generated annotations regarding discounts via coupon codes. FYI: most Payment Gateways impose an upper limit ( e.g. PayPal® = 127 max total ). In other words, s2Member must reduce max characters allowed in the `desc=""` attribute so it has plenty of room for its own annotations.
* **(s2Member). Bug fix.** When s2Member was running together with BuddyPress, `wp-login.php?redirect_to=` logic implemented by BuddyPress was conflicting with s2Member's handling of `wp-login.php?redirect_to=`, including Login Welcome Page redirection. s2Member v3.5 resolves this BuddyPress conflict by removing all Filters applied by BuddyPress to `login_redirect`; thereby eliminating the conflict all together. This conflict was resolved in favor of s2Member, because s2Member provides a very comprehensive option configuration for this behavior in it's General Options panel.
* **(s2Member). Bug fix.** s2Member's Alternative View Protection was not working properly when the `All` setting was applied to child/sub Category restrictions. At least, not in the same way that s2Member handles all of its other child Category restrictions. This bug has been corrected in v3.5 so that all child/sub Categories of a protected parent Category are filtered by s2Member's Alternative View Protection when this option is set to `All`.
* **(s2Member Pro). Bug fix.** s2Member's integration with AliPay® was attempting to process duplicate IPN responses from the AliPay® server. Apparently AliPay® finds it necessary to continue prodding the IPN handler multiple times. In order to prevent duplicate processing, s2Member now employs a Transient array of already-processed Notification IDs; allowing it to silently ignore duplicate IPNs ( they will still be logged though, as they should be ).
* **(s2Member). Compatibility.** s2Member's handling of protected file delivery through `chunks` has been updated to support the full valid protocol of `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`. This should eliminate any remaining file delivery issues on GoDaddy shared hosting accounts and the like.
* **(s2Member). Compatibility.** s2Member's directory locations for `/s2member-files/` and `/s2member-logs/` are now nested into a sub-directory of `/app_data/` ONLY on Windows® servers. This way all files in these directories will be secured from public access in a Windows® environment. On a Windows® server, the `/app_data/` directory name is special. Files within a directory with this special name are automatically protected from public access, without needing to create an `.htaccess` workaround, or use a `web.config` file. In addition, s2Member now makes two WordPress® Filters available ( `ws_plugin__s2member_files_dir` and `ws_plugin__s2member_logs_dir` ) giving developers the ability to move their protected files and/or logs to a custom directory of their choosing; if/when this is needed in special cases.
* **(s2Member). tinyURLs.** s2Member's limited use of the tinyURL service for shrinking links inserted into email messages has been improved upon in this release. As of s2Member v3.5+, all tinyURLs are now appended with your domain name; making them easier for Customers to read, and improving their overall appearance.
* **(s2Member). Bug fix.** Under certain circumstances, s2Member was generating administrative URLs with `/wp-admin/?page=...` instead of `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=...`. A common symptom of this bug was to see an error in your Dashboard, something like: `You do not have permission to access this page`. This has been resolved in s2Member v3.5+.
* **(s2Member). Bug fix.** Corrected layout issue on s2Member's Multisite (Config) panel. The field for `Level #0 Blogs Allowed` was not being hidden properly under certain circumstances; depending on the Multisite configuration being applied. This has been corrected in s2Member v3.5.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). New Hook for Multisite Blog Farm developers.** s2Member now makes a new Hook available; allowing Multisite Blog Farms to prevent the s2Member Pro module from loading on certain child Blogs, or under other special circumstances. You'll find this Hook inside `/s2member/s2member.php` ( `ws_plugin__s2member_load_pro` ).
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). Multisite Blog Farms.** The dynamic mutation of s2Member's built-in documentation has been updated to provide better ( i.e. more appropriate ) information to Administrators of child Blogs on a Multisite Blog Farm.
* **(s2Member Pro). Instruction.** Additional instructions have been added to the s2Member Pro panel for PayPal® Pro Forms. This new information includes details regarding workarounds when you do NOT have access to a PayPal® *Pro* account. FYI: It is no longer an *absolute requirement* that a site owner have a PayPal® Pro account; you can still use Pro Forms; as long as you have PayPal® Express Checkout ( which is free ).
* **(s2Member). Conflict prevention.** s2Member now provides warnings in the Dashboard whenever novice site owners attempt to configure their Login Welcome Page or Membership Options Page as their Home Page ( i.e. static page ) for WordPress®; or as the static Posts Page. These conflict warnings will appear under: `WordPress® -> Reading Options` when/if a configuration conflict arises.
* **(s2Member Pro). Bug fix.** Some of the new Button Generators for ClickBank®, AliPay®, Google® Checkout were using the JavaScript `escape()` function instead of `encodeURIComponent()`; leaving the possibility for certain characters ( such as `+` signs ) to be misinterpreted when passed through a URL/query string. This bug has been resolved in s2Memeber v3.5+ and s2Member Pro v1.5+.
* **(s2Member Pro). Upgrader/bug fix.** The automatic upgrader for the s2Member Pro module was inadvertently deleting itself ( sometimes ) whenever an upgrade failed through WordPress® with script memory/timeout errors. This routine has been modified to better handle it's "point of no return" by unzipping the latest distribution into a separate temporary directory. In addition to this change, the update routine now analyzes your server configuration to ensure enough memory is available before the update routine begins. In the event that your installation lacks the memory required ( at least 256M ) to unzip the s2Member Pro module, a warning to that affect will be displayed and you will need to upload the `/s2member-pro/` directory via FTP instead; following instructions in the `/readme.txt` file.
 IMPORTANT: Since previous versions of the automatic updater did NOT include these important enhancements, you may not be able to use the automatic updater in your current version of s2Member Pro. Long story short, we believe the issues HAVE been corrected for "future" releases, but in order to upgrade to this release, you may need to download a copy at s2Member.com and upload it manually via FTP. Full instructions are provided in the `/readme.txt` file, and on the site at s2Member.com.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). Documentation.** Documentation updated/improved throughout several areas of s2Member and s2Member Pro.

= 3.3.2 =
* Tested against WordPress® 3.0.3. Everything looks good.
* (s2Member) Bug fix. s2Member was ignoring `?redirect_to=value` upon login, in favor of the Login Welcome Page configured for s2Member. s2Member v3.3.2 has been updated to allow the use of `redirect_to`; and to simply default to the Login Welcome Page when no `redirect_to` argument is passed in. This is the intended behavior. As of s2Member v3.3.2 this now works fully as expected.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) Bug fix. s2Member was incorrectly calculating delayed EOT Times under certain circumstances. This was related to non-recurring Subscriptions processed on PayPal® accounts opened after October 15th, 2009. Under the right scenario, PayPal's IPN responses were fooling s2Member, by immediately expiring payments; and sending a `recurring_payment_expired` IPN before the `recurring_payment` IPN. So s2Member was incorrectly calculating the EOT Time ( i.e. `last_payment_time` was not properly considered ). The logic behind s2Member's IPN handling routines has been corrected in v3.3.2 to resolve this issue.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) SEO / Search Engine Optimization. s2Member now sends 301 redirect headers instead of the default WordPress® 302. This prevents duplicate content warnings from search engines such as Google®. In other words, when s2Member redirects visitors ( and/or search engine spiders ) to your Membership Options Page, in response to an attempt to access a secured area of your site; the `wp_redirect()` call will send a 301 redirect header instead of a 302. This prevents duplicate content warnings associated with your Membership Options Page. In addition, a universal Filter ( i.e. `ws_plugin__s2member_content_redirect_status` ) has been added to s2Member's source code, giving developers the ability to modify this behavior dynamically; if they need to.
* (s2Member Pro) Bug fix. s2Member Pro's AliPay® integration was incorrectly handling Return URLs on success. This release fixes the invalid syntax inside `/functions/separates/alipay-return.inc.php`.
* (s2Member Pro) Compatibility. s2Member Pro Forms are now compatible with jQuery v1.4.4. jQuery v1.4.4 introduced the need for double-quotations around all attribute/value selectors.
* (s2Member Pro) New Pro Form attribute. s2Member Pro Forms now accept a new Attribute ( i.e. `template=""` ). This allows developers to integrate Pro Forms with custom template files, on a per-Form basis. For further details on this topic, please check your Dashboard under: `s2Member -> PayPal® Pro Forms -> Shortcode Attributes (explained)`.
* (s2Member) Bug fix. A bug that was first introduced in v3.3 was causing AWeber integrations to fail with email addresses being picked up as the administrative address instead of the Customer's address. This was related to a previous change in v3.3 where all `mail()` commands were converted to `wp_mail()` for improved compatibility. With this release ( s2Member v3.3.2 ), the bug with AWeber integration has been resolved. Thanks to everyone for reporting this important issue.

= 3.3.1 =
* Tested against WordPress® 3.0.2. Everything looks good.
* Updated Stable Tag to v3.3.1. s2Member is compatible with WordPress® 3.0+ ( including WP 3.0.2 ).

= 3.3 =
* (s2Member) Bug fix / File Downloads. Use of PHP's `fread()` function has been updated to `stream_get_contents()` with a 2MB chunk size in order to satisfy the needs of site owners delivering VERY large files ( 500MB+ ) though simulated HTTP streams "inline". For instance, an MP4 video file into a FlowPlayer/JWPlayer or another Flash-based application. In addition, s2Member is now capable of output buffering its chunked file delivery, making it possible for s2Member to deliver VERY large files through most shared hosting platforms without needing to upgrade to a private server.
* (s2Member) Bug fix / BuddyPress. Bug fix. New filter added in support of BuddyPress on a Multisite installation. `add_filter ("bp_signup_usermeta", "c_ws_plugin__s2member_registrations::ms_process_signup_meta");`
* (s2Member) Bug fix / BuddyPress. Improved detection of BuddyPress activation/registration slugs using `BP_ACTIVATION_SLUG`, `BP_REGISTER_SLUG` in conjunction with improved routing of `$usermeta` data inside `/s2member/includes/functions/config-user-registration.inc.php`. This resolves an issue where s2Member was not properly applying Membership Levels ( e.g. an s2 Role ) with BuddyPress installed on a Multisite Network.
* (s2Member) Custom Registration Fields. s2Member's API Notifications now support custom Replacement Codes for any Custom Registration Fields that you've configured with s2Member. This makes it easier for developers to integrate 3rd party services, because s2Member's API Notifications can now be configured to send additional information that may include data entered by your Customer into a Custom Registration Field. Also, s2Member still supports the `custom="domain|cv1|cv2|cv3|etc..."` Attribute in your Shortcode too. For full details, check your Dashboard under: `s2Member -> API Notifications`.
* (s2Member) Improved documentation on various Replacement Codes available for s2Member. There are also some new Replacement Codes made available in various sections/integrations.
* (s2Member) In WordPress®, when you list all `Users`, you will find a search box in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. This search box now has the ability to find Members by `Username, Display Name, Nickname, s2Member / Paid Subscr. ID, Custom String, and ANY Custom Registration Field value`.
* (s2Member) Advanced Content Dripping. A new PHP/API Constant has been made available for Content Dripping `S2MEMBER_CURRENT_USER_PAID_REGISTRATION_DAYS` ( note the addition of "PAID" ). Also, s2Member v3.3 includes an entirely new/alternative method for Dripping Content, using a new API Function called `s2member_registration_time ([level])`. You will find all of the information/documentation on this topic inside your Dashboard under: `s2Member -> API Scripting -> Content Dripping`. s2Member now has the ability to provide you with information about when a Member pays you at each specific Membership Level. That being said, there IS an issue with this... The new function `s2member_registration_time ()` will NOT return data correctly for existing Members that paid you prior to you upgrading to s2Member v3.3+. This is because s2Member did NOT record all of this information in previous versions. So it can't give you what it doesn't have on any of your existing Members. Please check the forums for workarounds.
* (s2Member) API Constants. s2Member v3.3 includes some new API Constants related to PayPal® and PayPal® Pro integration. Such as the configured PayPal® API Username, Password, Signature, etc. These will make it easier for other extensions to be built on top of s2Member should the need arise.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) Documentation updated throughout. Some minor wording changes were required here-and-there in order to prevent confusion with all of s2Member Pro's new Gateway integrations.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) All of s2Member's Button Generators now give you the ability to set a Trial Period and a separate Trial Billing Amount. So instead of just offering a 100% free Trial Period, you can now offer an Initial Period at one price, but have the Subscription billed later at a different Regular Recurring rate.
* (s2Member Pro) New configuration panel added to s2Member Pro. The new `Other Gateways` panel allows you to enable/disable other Payment Gateways that have been integrated with s2Member Pro.
* (s2Member Pro) Google® Checkout. s2Member Pro has been integrated with Google® for Direct Payments and also for Recurring Billing. In order to take advantage of this new integration method, you will need to have a copy of s2Member Pro, and a Google® Checkout Account. A Google® Checkout account is free.
* (s2Member Pro) ClickBank®. s2Member Pro has now been integrated with ClickBank® for Direct Payments and also for Recurring Billing. In order to take advantage of this new integration method, you will need to have a copy of s2Member Pro, and a ClickBank® Merchant Account. Otherwise, you can just use the PayPal® Standard integration that comes with the free version of s2Member.
* (s2Member Pro) AliPay®. s2Member Pro has been integrated with AliPay® for Direct Payments. In order to take advantage of this new integration method, you will need to have an AliPay® Merchant Account with Direct Pay enabled ( aka: 前台自助--即时到账收款 ). This can sometimes take a couple of days to acquire. Once you've been approved at AliPay®, you'll be given a Partner ID, and a Security Code; which you'll need to configure inside your `s2Member -> AliPay® Options`.
* (s2Member Pro) PayPal® Pro integration with s2Member Pro, now supports Coupon Codes that can be configured to ONLY apply to (ta) Trial Amounts, or (ra) Regular Amounts. For further details and examples, please check your Dashboard under: `s2Member -> Coupon Codes`.
* (s2Member Pro) PayPal® Pro Forms with s2Member Pro, can now be configured to recur at these new intervals: Bi-Weekly, Bi-Monthly, and Quarterly recurring cycles.
* (s2Member Pro) Documentation. New documentation on ALL of s2Member's Shortcode Attributes for Pro Forms, Standard Shortcodes, and other Payment Gateways; is now included inside your Dashboard. For each Payment Gateway that you enable, there will be a Button Generator available in the s2Member Menu panel. At the bottom of each Button Generating station, you'll find a detailed examination of s2Member's Shortcode Attributes. This should make s2Member even easier for developers to integrate.

= 3.2.9 =
* Compatibility. s2Member's Custom Field interface was being negatively impacted by the Prototype library for JavaScript; which is utilized by some other popular plugins, such as WP-O-Matic. As a result, on some installations of s2Member ( depending on your plugin combination ), a few site owners were seeing a jumbled mix of fields in their General Options panel for s2Member. This conflict with the Prototype library has been resolved in s2Member v3.2.9+.

 If ( and ONLY if ) you were experiencing this issue in previous versions of s2Member, it is recommended that you delete all of your existing Custom Fields for s2Member and re-create them. If you don't delete all of your corrupted Custom Fields and start over, the issue may *appear* to still exist; but it HAS been corrected.

= 3.2.8 =
* Unique IP Restrictions. There is a new option under: `s2Member -> General Options -> IP Restrictions` which allows a site owner to effectively disable IP Restrictions if they'd prefer. On some hosting platforms, the `$_SERVER["REMOTE_ADDR"]` variable ( i.e. a Users IP address ) is incorrectly set to the exact same thing for all visitors; which WILL prevent s2Member's IP Restrictions from working as intended. If you're on a hosting platform that has this bug, you may wish to disable IP Restrictions completely using s2Member v3.2.8+. Otherwise, under most circumstances we recommend that you leave IP Restrictions on.

= 3.2.7 =
* Custom Fields ( new features ). s2Member is now equipped with a VERY powerful set of features; designed to extend the functionality of Custom Fields. s2Member now supports Text Fields ( single/multi-line ), Checkboxes ( single/multi-option ), Radio Buttons ( single/multi-option ), and Dropdowns ( single/multi-option ). In addition, with s2Member it is now possible to configure Custom Fields differently for each Membership Level. Other tools: including Validation Formats and Visibility are also available. For full details, check your Dashboard under: `s2Member -> General Options -> Custom Fields`.
* Attn Developers ( before upgrading ). Hooks/Filters ( e.g. those related to Custom Fields ) have been modified in ways that may break custom scripts you've created to work with previous versions of s2Member. We suggest dropping all of your Hooks/Filters related to Custom Fields. Instead, use the NEW improved tools w/s2Member v3.2.7+. Please see: `s2Member -> General Options -> Custom Fields`.
* BuddyPress/Multisite. A plugin conflict was resolved between BuddyPress/s2Member when both of these plugins were installed on a Multisite Network together. BuddyPress bypasses the default Filter ( `pre_site_option_registration` ) and instead, it uses: `bp_core_get_site_options()`. This has been resolved in s2Member v3.2.6+.
* Bug fix. A bug was found in s2Member's handling of Custom Fields columns. This minor bug was conflicting with other plugins that attempt to create User-based columns. This was been resolved in s2Member v3.2.7+.
* New Shortcode attribute. s2Member's PayPal Button Shortcode now accepts a new attribute ( `ta="0.00"`, Trial Amount ). In the past, if you intended to offer a "paid" Initial Period at a different price, you had to use the Full Button Code. Now you can just change the `ta="0.00"` attribute ( which is easier ).
* More informative. s2Member now generates warnings for newbies that create conflicts between their Membership Options Page and Login Welcome Page. s2Member is now capable of detecting the most common conflicts, in order to produce informative messages that assist site owners.
* Login/Registration Design. s2Member v3.2.7+ includes additional customization tools that allow font sizes and font families to be configured for the Login/Registration system. In your Dashboard, go to: `s2Member -> General Options -> Login/Registration Design`.
* Bug fix. The Default Profile Editing Panel ( e.g. `/wp-admin/profile.php` ) was NOT validating Custom Fields. s2Member v3.2.7 resolves this for Users/Members. Administrators are exempt ( the intended functionality ).
* Better instructions inside in the General Options panel for s2Member. Just a few subtle improvements based on User feedback. Hopefully these will make life a little easier for newbies.

= 3.2.5 =
* IP Restrictions ( reset ). Several site owners have reported issues with s2Member's IP Restrictions. A full investigation has been performed. Although no bugs were found, we suspect that recent reports on this topic are related to a combination of a.) improvements in recent versions of s2Member, with respect to IP Restrictions ( adaptive concurrency limits ); and b.) lack of support ( on the part of s2Member ) for resetting IP Restriction Logs after changes in configuration. In this release of s2Member, we've introduced a new tool for site owners, which allows you to Reset IP Restriction Logs manually, at anytime you like. For further details, please see: `s2Member -> General Options -> IP Restrictions` ( look for the new button titled: `Reset IP Restriction Logs`. ).
* Compatibility. s2Member's activation/deactivation routines have been updated to support installations of WordPress® that may, or may not, already have the default WordPress® Roles installed. For instance, some installations of WordPress® are running with Role managing plugins. A site owner could have modified WordPress®, and may no longer have one, or even all of these default Roles: `administrator, editor, author, contributor, subscriber`. s2Member is now capable of dealing with this scenario gracefully upon activation/deactivation.

= 3.2.4 =
* BuddyPress ( bug ). A bug that was first introduced in s2Member v3.2.3 with Hook priority on `template_redirect` was causing compatiblity issues with BuddyPress. This has been corrected in s2Member v3.2.4+.
* Bug fix. The s2Member Meta Box panel was not being displayed with Custom Post Types. This has been resolved in s2Member v3.2.4+.

= 3.2.3 =
* New Feature - "Alternative View Protection". Check your Dashboard: `s2Member -> General Options -> Alternative View Protection`. This new feature deals with some long awaited (protection) for things like: search results, RSS/XML feeds, and custom queries; where excerpts of protected content may slip through, depending on your theme. This feature is NEW, and still in an experimental state. It is disabled by default, but we encourage you to try it with different settings, and report back to us through the support forums for s2Member.
* New Feature - "Query Conditionals" for developers. Check your Dashboard: `s2Member -> API Scripting -> Query Conditionals`. s2Member now provides several built-in API Functions that are tailored to meet the needs of developers integrating s2Member into their themes. Such as: `is_category_protected_by_s2member($cat_id)`, `is_category_permitted_by_s2member($cat_id)`, `is_tag_protected_by_s2member($tag_id [slug or tag name])`, `is_tag_permitted_by_s2member($tag_id [slug or tag name])`, `is_post_protected_by_s2member($post_id)`, `is_post_permitted_by_s2member($post_id)`, `is_page_protected_by_s2member($page_id)`, `is_page_permitted_by_s2member($page_id)`, `is_uri_protected_by_s2member($uri [or full url])`, `is_uri_permitted_by_s2member($uri [ or full url])`. In addition, there are two special functions that can be applied by theme authors before making custom queries: `attach_s2member_query_filters()`, `detach_s2member_query_filters()`. These can be used before and after a call to `query_posts()` for example. s2Member will automatically filter all protected content ( not available to the current User/Member ). Further details on these functions is available under the `API Scripting` section in your Dashboard. You can also have a look at this file: `/s2member/includes/functions/api-functions.inc.php`.
* Compatiblity. s2Member is now compatible with the [Page Tagger](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/page-tagger/) plugin for WordPress®. Installing this plugin will allow you to protect Pages with Tags ( optional ). s2Member is also compatible with HeadSpace2 SEO, which can also enable Tags for Pages.
* Bug fix. A bug was found in s2Member's handling of PayPal® EOT responses. This bug was affecting site owners with newer PayPal® accounts ( i.e. their Subscription IDs start with `I-` ). These newer PayPal® accounts trigger `subscr_eot` events upon last payment, instead of when time has actually expired. s2Member v3.2.3 has been updated to correct its handling of `subscr_eot` events in this scenario. An obvious symptom of this bug, was to sell a non-recurring Subscription, and have that Subscription EOT on the very same day as the first payment ( which was also the last payment ), because it was non-recurring. This has been resolved in s2Member v3.2.3+.
* New API Notification. s2Member v3.2.3 includes a new API Notification that can provide details about Refund/Reversal events, which are related to transactions for "Specific Post/Page Access". s2Member has always provided Refund/Reversal Notifications, but NOT for Specific Post/Page Access. There are now two API Notifications for Specific Post/Page Access. One for initial Sales, and another for Refunds/Reversals ( i.e. chargebacks ).
* Replacement Codes. s2Member v3.2.3 adds two additional Replacement Codes to the API Notification for cancellations. These two additional Replacement Codes are: `%%item_number%%`, and `%%item_name%%`. See: `s2Member -> API Notifications -> Cancellations` for further details.
* Optimization. Some of s2Member's larger routines have been moved into the `/functions/separates/` directory, and they're now loaded "as needed", as opposed to being loaded by default. This will further optimize sites powered by s2Member. In addition, ( FYI for developers ) there are plans to implement `SPL Autoload` into a future release of s2Member, through classes assigned to various parts of the s2Member software package.
* Improvement. s2Member's Meta Box panels in the Post/Page editing stations are now designed to disable themselves automatically on special Pages that are handled automatically by s2Member; ( i.e. the Membership Options Page, Login Welcome Page, Download Limit Exceeded Page ). s2Member also provides site owners with a clearer picture of how it handles these special Pages through the Meta Box panel.
* General Maintenance. These two files `paypal-notify.inc.php`, and `paypal-return.inc.php` have BOTH been through another round of testing. Log file analysis ( with the help of other site owners ) indicated there were a few tweaks needed here and there. Minor changes were performed to improve compatibility for both PayPal® Standard and PayPal® Pro IPN handling ( across both old and new PayPal® accounts ). Things like `product_name` vs. `item_name` vs. `item_name1`; and `item_number` vs. `item_number1`, vs. `rp_invoice_id` parsing.
* New Shortcode Attribute. s2Member now accepts another PayPal® Button Shortcode attribute ( `ns="1"` ) is s2Member's default setting. This controls the `no_shipping` variable in your PayPal® Button. `0` – to prompt for a shipping address, but NOT require one ( enables shipping details via IPN ). `1` – to NEVER prompt for a shipping address. `2` – to prompt for a shipping address, AND require one ( enables shipping details via IPN ).
* Coming soon. Improvements to s2Member's support for Custom Fields did NOT make it into the official release of s2Member v3.2.3. Further beta testing is required. Support for selects, radios, checkboxes, and other improvements will come in s2Member v3.2.5.
* Additional changes in "s2Member Pro" have been [recorded here](http://www.s2member.com/).

= 3.2.2 =
* Simple Conditionals ( completely re-written ). Simple Conditionals, first introduced in s2Member v3.2.1; have been completely re-written to support a wider range of features. The **new Shortcode** is `s2If`. The older Shortcodes have now been deprecated: `s2All, s2Any` ( do NOT use ). The older Shortcodes will continue to work with backward compatiblity, but they'll be removed in a future release of s2Member. Please update any existing Shortcodes referencing `s2All,s2Any` ( do NOT use ), by switching them all over to `s2If` instead. We apologize for the drastic changes to this new feature; but it was a necessary step forward. The initial release of Simple Conditionals was very buggy, and NOT as extensible as the new `s2If` logic is now. If you've been using Simple Conditionals, you will need to re-review all documentation and code samples. The new `s2If` Shortcode is fully documented, inside your WordPress® Dashboard under: `s2Member -> API Scripting -> Simple Conditionals`.
* Starting with s2Member v3.2.3, "Simple Conditionals" are now available to you from within WordPress®, using Shortcodes that are fully compatible with both the Visual Editor, and also the HTML Tab in WordPress®. We've been through all of the documentation for s2Member, and updated (again) ALL code samples to provide you with Shortcode equivalents. You can learn more about this new feature in your WP Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> API Scripting -> Simple Conditionals`. Simple Conditionals are a NEW feature, and they'll have no affect on Advanced Conditionals; which have always been available for s2Member.
* Bug Dodging. A call to `get_defined_constants(true)` inside `css-js-w-globals.inc.php` was causing a segfault on some installations of PHP 5.2. Bug reports at PHP.net indicate this is caused by the `(true)` argument being passed; and under the right conditions ( e.g. with the right combination of PHP extensions installed ) this can result in a segfault. In this release of s2Member ( v3.2.2 ), we've dodged this PHP bug completely, by implementing a different method for tracking the integrity of API Constants, thereby circumventing this odd behavior on some Apache/PHP installations. s2Member no longer makes any calls to the `get_defined_constants()` function.
* New Feature. s2Member can now send automatic API Notification Emails, which include a full Transaction Log for each API Notification event. In other words, you can now tell s2Member to send emails to different addresses, for each of s2Member's API Notification events. For further details, see: `s2Member -> API Notifications`. Look for "Email Transaction Log" under each sub-section. This new feature will make it easier to integrate s2Member with back-office routines, and in particular, easier to integrate with 3rd-party list servers - other than MailChimp/AWeber, which s2Member already supports natively. This new feature also makes it easier to build confidence in s2Member. As a Site Owner, you may configure email notifications for each event, and monitor s2Member's behavior.
* New API Notification. s2Member can now process separate API Notifications for "Cancellation" events. For further details, see: `s2Member -> API Notifications -> Cancellations`. Using this feature in conjunction with the new Email Transaction Logs, you can be notified via email; each time a Cancellation occurs.
* Bug fix. On a Multisite Blog Farm, s2Member was missing an important Hook/Filter ( `signup_hidden_fields` ) during a registration that included both an account, and also a Blog. This bug has been resolved with s2Member v3.2.2+.

= 3.2.1 =
* Feature. s2Member now comes equipped with an advanced behavioral setting; specifically geared toward two special events ( Refunds/Reversals ). With s2Member v3.2.1+, you will find a new option which gives you more control over the way s2Member handles these two events. In your WP Dashboard, see: `s2Member -> PayPal® Options -> EOT Behavior`.
* Bug fix. s2Member's bbPress Bridge integration was using a hard-coded reference to `wp_capabilities`, instead of using an option call to determine the WordPress® table prefix that was needed for some installations. This was affecting installations of WordPress® that were using a non-standard `wp_` prefix. Corrected in s2Member v3.2.1. In addition, another bug was found, causing the error: `missing argument` in preg_replace. This has also been corrected with s2Member v3.2.1+.
* Bug fix. Invalid method `WP_User->hap_cap()`. This should have been `WP_User->has_cap()`. This was negatively affecting the new Custom Capabilities per-Post/Page introduced in the previous release of s2Member v3.2. This bug has been resolved with s2Member v3.2.1+.
* Hooks/Filters. Several new Hooks/Filters for Custom Fields. The upcoming release of s2Member v3.3 will include many new features for Custom Fields. In the mean time, these new Hooks/Filters integrated into `/includes/functions/register-access.inc.php` will make it easier for developers to maniuplate the display of Custom Fields. One such example is the Filter `ws_plugin__s2member_during_custom_registration_fields_during_custom_fields_display`.
* Forcing SSL w/ PayPal® Pro integration. The Custom Field `s2member_force_ssl=yes` is now more powerful. s2Member is now capable of forcing SSL ( i.e. `https://` ) on certain Posts/Pages, WITHOUT causing a site-wide conversion to https. In other words, s2Member can now buffer content without affecting href tags within that content, and/or in your navigation menus. Improvements to this routine make integrations of PayPal® Pro Forms easier than ever. Just add this Custom Field to any Post/Page that you want to force SSL on: `s2member_force_ssl=yes`. This is compatible with almost ANY WordPress® theme. Or, if your host requires a specific port number in the URL, use this instead: `s2member_force_ssl=443`. This Custom Field can be added in your Post/Page editing stations; inside WordPress®. ( * This is also compatible with the Quick Cache plugin for WordPress®, so that PayPal® Pro Forms can be cached initially for speed optimization. )
* IP Restrictions ( i.e. `s2Member -> General Options -> IP Restrictions` ), have been enhanced to provide better security against slower attacks that may span several weeks/months. s2Member's IP Restrictions are now capable of internal concurrency timeouts on a per-IP basis, as opposed to just a per entry-point basis. In addition, s2Member is now smarter about the way it enforces your configured Punishment Period. Some additional documentation on how IP Restrictions work, is now available in your s2Member General Options panel. There's nothing you need to change though; just review the updated details on this topic in your General Options panel for s2Member.
* Bug fix. The new Meta Box panel that was made available in the previous release of s2Member ( e.g. in your Post/Page editing stations ), was saving an empty array when there were no Custom Capabilities being specified/required. This is/was harmless; however, it WAS causing `s2member_ccaps_req` to appear in the Custom Fields drop-down menu for each Post/Page; even with no Custom Capabilities were required. This confusing behavior has been resolved with s2Member v3.2.1+.
* Bug fix. A new feature added in the previous release of s2Member, making it possible to Add A User through WordPress® ( including all s2Member fields initially, without a subsequent Edit ), was working with Multisite enabled, but broken WITHOUT Multisite enabled. This has been resolved with s2Member v3.2.1+. This feature is now working with or without Multisite Networking enabled.

= 3.2 =
* New Feature. s2Member now provides a small panel ( aka: `meta box` ) inside your Post/Page editing stations. This new panel makes it possible for you to restrict access to a Post/Page, or even a Custom Post Type ( on-the-fly ) without having to go back to your General Options panel all the time. Starting with s2Member v3.2+, you can also tell s2Member to require Custom Capabilities on a per Post/Page basis. So now, s2Member ( if you prefer ) can handle Custom Capabilities for you! Whenever you edit a Post/Page, you can tell s2Member to require certain Custom Capabilities that you type in, using comma-delimited format. In other words, you will need to type in some of the trigger words that you used whenever you created your PayPal® Pro Forms and/or Standard PayPal® Buttons. This way your Members will have the proper Capabilities to view different kinds of content that you offer. All of this is optional.
* Compatibility. s2Member, and also the s2Member Pro Module; have both been tested under WordPress® 3.0.1. Everything looks good - no conflicts.
* Multisite Networking. s2Member, and also the s2Member Pro Module; are now compatible with WordPress® 3.0+ Multisite Networking, formerly known as WPMU. In addition, preliminary ( experimental ) support for Multisite Blog Farms has also been implemented. If you\'re running a Multisite Blog Farm ( i.e. you offer Blogs ), please contact s2Member.com for further details.
* A new panel is made available under `s2Member -> Multisite ( Config )`, whenever [Multisite Networking](http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network) is enabled. This is where a Super Administrator ( operating on the Main Site ) can decide to offer Membership only, or Membership with Blog creation as well. In other words, your site could ALSO offer a Customer access to create a Blog of their own, where a Customer becomes a "Member" of your ( Main Site ), and also a Blog Owner/Administrator. With s2Member installed ( network wide ), each of your Customers could offer Membership too, using a single installation of the s2Member plugin ( which is a great selling point! ). We refer to this as a Multisite Blog Farm.
* Bug fix. The s2Member Framework has been updated to fully support installations of WordPress® that have two different URLs configured in their `WP Settings -> General` section. This bug was related to `bloginfo ("url")` vs. `bloginfo ("wpurl")`. In previous versions of s2Member, a major symptom of this bug was an unexpected redirection to the Home Page after checkout, instead of a formal response to the Customer. This bug was only affecting installations of WordPress® that were using a different Site Address URL, inside their `Settings -> General` panel. This has been resolved in s2Member v3.2+.
* Bug fix. An issue related to protected File Downloads, where a site owner was using sub-directories to guard specific files from specific Levels, was sometimes resulting in an invalid redirection to the Membership Options Page, with a query string indicating `21`, ( i.e. `s2member_level_req=21` ). This bug has been corrected in s2Member v3.2+.
* Videos. Over six hours of detailed [Video Tutorials](http://www.s2member.com/videos/) are now available for s2Member. Additional videos will be released over the coming days and weeks ahead; covering more advanced topics, marketing tips, and an in-depth look at the [s2Member Pro Module](http://www.s2member.com/prices/), plus Multisite Networking; which is also evolving rapidly.
* API Behavior. s2Member's API Notification for EOT/Deletions, has been changed slightly. In previous versions, the EOT/Deletion notification was only processed for a ( paid ) Member, who reached the end of their term, OR ... if a ( paid ) Member was manually deleted by an Administrator through the Dashboard. Starting with s2Member v3.2+, an EOT/Deletion Notification will be processed, EVEN if the account is NOT currently associated with a ( paid ) Member. In other words, starting with s2Member v3.2, if you delete an account manually ( through your WP Dashboard ) this will ALWAYS trigger s2Member's EOT/Deletion Notification; no matter what. For further details, check your Dashboard: `s2Member -> API Notifications -> EOT/Deletion`.
* Bug fix. Login message filter ( `login_messages` ) applied to registrations with a custom password entered during the registration process. `Registration complete. Please log in.` This Hook/Filter was renamed to just ( `login_message` ) with the release of WordPress® 3.0.1. Very minor issue, but this has been corrected with s2Member v3.2+ - in support of WordPress® 3.0.1+.
* Feature. Custom Registration Fields for s2Member, now support an Un-editable Mode ( in other words, if you want specific fields to be un-editable after registration ), you can wrap those Custom Fields inside ^carets^. In your WP Dashboard, see: `s2Member -> General Options -> Custom Fields` for additional documentation and examples.
* Profile Editing Panel. The Stand-Alone Profile Modification Page ( provided by s2Member ); now includes a password confirmation field ( in other words, a NEW password must be typed in twice as a confirmation ).
* BuddyPress/MailChimp. The first/last name fields were NOT being populated into the MailChimp® integration with BuddyPress installed. This has been resolved with s2Member v3.2+.
* Logging routines. s2Member's logging routines have been updated to support Multisite Networking. When Multisite Networking is enabled, s2Member will keep separate log files for each domain/path.
* Validation. The JavaScript validation routine for the `wp-login.php` file, now includes the Username/Email Address to help Customers avoid confusion.
* Feature. Integration of Custom Fields into the `Users -> Add New` panel. An account can now be created manually, with all details included initially. As opposed to the old way, where you had to go back and Edit the account manually, after the initial creation.
* Feature. s2Member now exposes its `s2member_custom` field inside the admin panel. You can go to your `Dashboard -> Users` panel, and click Edit next to a Member. The Custom String is now editable. You're NOT likely to need this, but s2Member makes it editable anyway. Possibly for advanced usage by a developer.
* Feature. Integration of Custom Fields into `/wp-signup.php` has been completed. This is only for Multisite Networking; where s2Member is being used in a Blog Farm environment.
* PayPal®. In the admin panel, a few subtle references to "PayPal®" have been changed to just "Paid"; leaving room for additional gateway integration possibilities that are coming soon.
* Feature. In the admin panel, there is now a shortcut link inside the s2Member menu panel; which leads a Site Administrator to `Add A Member` using manual entry.
* Compatibility. On a Multisite Network; s2Member is NOT compatible with configurations that use a different Dashboard Blog; other than the Main Site. This is NOT a good idea to try this with s2Member; it opens the door for all sorts of issues. s2Member now forces your Dashboard Blog to the Main Site for sanity/compatibility/security.
* Compatibility. Added support for this Conditional Tag `current_user_can_for_blog( $blog_id, $capability )` in support of Multisite Networking integration. As well as `$user->for_blog( $blog_id )`.
* Compatibility. Updated function calls with `usermeta` to `user_option`; including `get_user_option()`, `update_user_option()`, `delete_user_option()`. The `usermeta` functions were deprecated as of WP 3.0. The new `get_user_option()` function is also Multisite compatible. If you're a developer, you can take a look at s2Member's source code for examples. Or read [this article](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_user_option).
* Important Database Change. In previous versions of s2Member, data about each Member was stored inside the `wp_usermeta` table automatically; and it STILL is. However, the `meta_key` names are now prefixed with `$wpdb->prefix`, which on most installations of WordPress® this translates to `wp_` ( e.g. `wp_s2member_subscr_id`, `wp_s2member_custom`, etc, etc. ). s2Member will automatically update your database tables upon re-activation. However, if you're a developer, and you've been using `get_usermeta($user_id, "s2member_subscr_id")`, you should now use `get_user_option("s2member_subscr_id", $user_id)` instead. No need to specify the `wp_` prefix in that function, it's handled internally by WordPress® through the `get_user_option()` call. For more information, please read [this article](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_user_option).
* Bug fix. s2Member's PayPal® IPN processor was logging `Skipping Auto-EOT for now ...`, with Refund/reversal IPNs; when a particular Member already had an EOT-Time set. This was NOT the intended behavior in this scenario. In this release, s2Member has been updated to ignore existing Auto-EOT Times under this one special circumstance ( Refund/Reversal ). A Refund/Reversal will ALWAYS trigger an immediate EOT now.
* IPN Proxy Keys. s2Member's implementation of the optional Proxy Key for simulated IPN responses, has been updated to support Multisite Networking; through a new PayPal® utility function `c_ws_plugin__s2member_paypal_utilities::paypal_proxy_key_gen ()`. For further details, check your Dashboard under `s2Member -> PayPal® Options -> IPN Integration -> Proxy Key`.
* UI Improvement. The tabindex property for [?] icons in the admin panel have been set to `tabindex="-1"` to prevent an annoyance.
* Compatibility. On a Windows® server, the cURL extension is usually NOT compatible with SSL communications. s2Member now signals to the WP_Http class, that it should temporarily disable the cURL transport when a remote URL is being processed with an `https://` prefix. This allows the WP_Http class to recover gracefully (automatically) and fall back on the FOPEN method. If you're running WordPress® on a Windows® server, you should make sure that you have this inside your php.ini file. ( `allow_url_fopen = on` ). A symptom of this bug, was to see an error in your paypal-ipn.log file, with something like: `Unable to verify _POST vars...`.
* Compatibility. s2Member's menu inside WordPress® now requires the `create_users` capability, instead of the more restrictive `edit_plugins`. This provides improved compatibility across various installations/configurations.
* API Notifications. s2Member's API Notification for Refund/Reversals, now includes a negative `%%-fee%%` Replacement Code; referencing the `mc_fee` variable sent through PayPal® IPN responses.
* General Maintenance. A full review of s2Member's source code was completed in this release. Including, but not limited to: general maintenance, code cleanup, optimizations.
* Login/Registration Design. Inside the General Options panel for s2Member, under `Login/Registration Design` there is a new option that allows you to configure the type of `Background Tiling` you prefer.
* Compatibility. The s2Member routine that responds to the `delete_user` Hook for WordPress®, has been safeguarded against duplicate processing via plugins ( or even WordPress® itself ).
* Improvement. s2Member now makes your Custom Fields available to a User/Member on the default Profile Editing Panel; the one inside WordPress®. Using this panel is still optional though; because s2Member includes a stand-alone panel as well ( see: `Profile Modifications, inside your s2Member -> General Options` ).
* API Notifications. s2Member's API Notification for Registration events, now (ALSO) includes ANY type of account that is created inside your Dashboard, under the `Users -> Add New` panel. In previous versions, the API Notification was NOT triggered for new accounts that were assigned a Role of Administrator/Editor/Author/Contributor in the Dashboard. Starting with s2Member v3.2+, they do! In conjunction with this change, comes a new Replacement Code `%%role%%` indicating the Role ID ( e.g. `subscriber, s2member_level[1-4], administrator, editor, author, contributor` ) associated with the new User. The Replacement Code `%%level%%` has been deprecated, please use `%%role%%` instead.
* Security Relaxation. In previous versions, s2Member has always prevented its processing routines from running on accounts with an Administrator/Editor/Author/Contributor Role. However, starting with v3.2+, s2Member WILL now process its routines for Editors/Authors/Contributors. Administrators will still NOT be processed under ANY circumstance though. The reason for this security relaxation, is to provide developers ( using Hooks/Filters ), with the ability to integrate s2Member in even more creative ways.
* Function removed. The function `ws_plugin__s2member_has_wp_role()` has been removed. It is no longer necessary. If you're a developer, and you've been using this function in previous versions... we suggest switching over to `current_user_can("[role name or capability])` instead. For more information, you can read [this article](http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities).
* Security hardening. s2Member's routines for analyzing and authenticating the validity of the three encrypted Cookies that it grants to a paying Customer - has been improved with s2Member v3.2.
* Replacement Codes. The `%%user_id%%` Replacement Code has been added to several other API Notifications now. Also, there are two new Replacement Codes for Payment Notifications ( `%%subscr_payment%%`, `%%subscr_payment_user_id%%` ). For further details, see: `s2Member -> API Notifications` in your Dashboard.
* Bug fix. The Default Password Nag that is built into WordPress® was not being suppressed whenever you allow Custom Passwords during registration. This has been resolved with s2Member v3.2+.

= 3.1.5 =
* Bug fix. The Replacment Code ( `%%current_user_level%%` ); which works in conjunction with a Login Welcome Page URL, and also with URI Level Access was always returning `-1`. This has been corrected in v3.1.5+.
* General cleanup and improved routines inside `/includes/file-download-access.inc.php`. No functionality changes, just subtle improvements in the logic behind s2Member's File Download Restrictions.
* New Replacement Code for s2Member's Registration API Notification. The Replacement Code ( `%%user_id%%` ) is now available to developers.

= 3.1.4 =
* Bug fix. Conditional check against `DOING_AJAX` added as an exclusion to the admin lockout routines for s2Member. This allows `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` to receive Ajax requests at all times, as it should be.

= 3.1.3 =
* Bug fix. Comparison between `$_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"]` and a PayPal® Custom/Proxy was failing on some servers that force a host port number into the `$_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"]` environment variable. MediaTemple® does this. If you're hosted by MediaTemple®, and you're using the s2Member Pro Module, you should upgrade to v3.1.3+.
* Bug fix. The WP_Http class, which is responsible for handling cURL, ExtHTTP, and/or fopen functionality for connections to PayPal®, was defaulting to a `5` second stream timeout. Under certain conditions, this was too low ( i.e. slow responses from PayPal®, and/or a WordPress® MySQL database ). The default timeout has now been increased to `20` seconds; which is designed to give high priority status to IPN processing routines; thereby reducing the chances of a connection timeout considerably, and improving the overall reliability of the s2Member checkout experience.
* Localhost support. s2Member now supports "localhost" installations of WordPress®; tested against WAMP and MAMP. Thanks to [ScriptyGoddess](http://www.scriptygoddess.com/) for reporting this, and for her assistance with testing against her MAMP installation.
* General UI cleanup. In particular, the PayPal® Option panels have been cleaned up a bit; making these important panels "less intimidating" to site owners that are brand new to s2Member.
* Support for File Download Restrictions, based on specific Member Level Sub-directories. For full details, please check your WP Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> API Scripting -> "Custom Capability and Member Level Files"`.
* The file `/includes/s2member.js` is now a development source file. The live version is now optimized, inside: `/includes/s2member-min.js`. This helps to further reduce the s2Member footprint.
* Virtual terminal support `(txn_type=virtual_terminal)` has been added to the s2Member IPN processor. This provides developers with access to Hooks/Filters on Virtual Terminal transactions.
* Internal optimization of s2member.css. These optimizations are designed to further reduce the footprint of s2Member.
* Bug fix. A bug was discovered in the PayPal® IPN routines; specifically with `payment_status`. Under the right conditions, it was possible for a declined echeck payment to slip through with a `Failed` payment status. s2Member v3.1.3+ corrects this bug.

= 3.1.2 =
* Updated minimum requirements to WordPress® 3.0+. There were changes in v3.1.1 that now require WP 3.0+ ( `apply_filters_ref_array` ). WordPress 2.9.2 is no longer compatible. If for some reason, you can't upgrade to WP 3.0, you can [grab older versions of s2Member here](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/s2member/download/).

= 3.1.1 =
* New feature. Now you can use `s2member_force_ssl -> yes` as a Custom Field with any Post/Page. This feature comes in handy if you need to force SSL on pages hosting PayPal® Pro Forms, implemented by the s2Member Pro Module. You can set `s2member_force_ssl -> yes` to force *https://*. If your server runs SSL over a special port number, or your server requires the port number to actually be in the URL ( i.e. HOST:port ), you can set `s2member_force_ssl -> 443`; or to whatever port you need. In addition to forcing *https://*, s2Member is also capable of forcing SSL compatibility in your theme, and in other quirky plugins. If your theme is NOT 100% compatible with SSL, s2Member can sometimes correct flaws automatically, but not always. For maximum compatibility with SSL, we recommend a premium WordPress® theme from PriMoThemes.com, or from another trusted source that states "SSL Compatible".
* Bug fix. References to the Constant `WP_CONTENT_URL` have been removed, in favor of `content_url()`, which is SSL-friendly.
* Tweak. References to `$_SERVER["HTTPS"]` have been abandoned, in favor of `is_ssl()`, which is native to WordPress®.
* Windows®. Although full testing on Windows® IIS is not completed, one bug report indicated a problem with `["dir_url"]`. This has been corrected in v3.1.1, using `DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR`.
* Bug fix. PHP 5.3.x reference value on option filters. The `apply_filters()` call was changed to `apply_filters_ref_array()`. This has been corrected in v3.1.1.
* Localhost support. s2Member now supports "localhost" installations of WordPress®; tested against WAMP and MAMP. Thanks to [ScriptyGoddess](http://www.scriptygoddess.com/) for reporting this, and for her assistance with testing against her MAMP installation.

= 3.1 =
* bbPress® compatiblity. There is a new internal Bridge that can be installed into bbPress® by s2Member. This new bbPress® (Bridge/plugin) makes it possible for s2Member Levels [0-4] to be converted into bbPress® "Members" on-the-fly, and it will guard your forums against unauthorized access; including forum registrations, which are redirected to your Membership Options Page for s2Member. To install this Bridge Integration, check your WordPress® Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> Bridge Integrations`.
* New plugin that is HIGHLY recommended for s2Member. Get [WP Show IDs](http://www.primothemes.com/post/product/wp-show-ids-plugin/). Simple, yet elegant. Shows IDs for Posts, Pages, Media, Links, Categories, Tags, and Users in the admin tables for easy access. Very lightweight. Also supports Custom Post Types / Taxonomies.
* New feature. There is a new Replacement Code available for the Login Welcome Page. You can now set a Special Redirection URL, which includes `%%current_user_level%%`, making it possible to have a separate Login Welcome Page for each Membership Level that you plan to offer. For further details, log into your WP Dashboard, and go to: `s2Member -> General Options -> Login Welcome Page`.
* New feature. s2Member now supports 3rd-party IPN integrations, where you can have another service, such as PayDotCom® send simulated IPN transactions to your s2Member installation. For further details, log into your WordPress® Dashboard, and go to: `s2Member -> PayPal Options -> IPN Integration` ( at the bottom of that sub-section, you'll find your Proxy IPN Key ). Full instructions for services like PayDotCom® &amp; eJunkie® will be provided in the next release. The framework is in place, but full documentation has not been written yet.
* New feature. s2Member now allows you to customize a list of Recipients for both the Signup Confirmation Email, and also the Specific Post/Page Confirmation Email. This makes it possible to prevent these emails from going out ( definitely NOT recommended though ). More importantly, it allows you to have copies of these messages sent to various departments, or even to a list server; such as AWeber/MailChimp. It should also be noted that your list of Recipients, your Subject Line, and your Messages; can all be modified easily, and ALL of these fields support the full list of Replacement Codes listed in those sections. For further details, see: `s2Member -> PayPal® Options`.
* Bug fix. A redirection loop was found within s2Member's security restrictions. A redirection loop was possible, whenever s2Member was running with an incomplete configuration ( i.e. no Membership Options Page was configured ). This has been corrected in v3.1. A new warning notice will be issued should you attempt to save your General Options without configuring a Membership Options Page. Also, s2Member will NOT enforce any of its security restrictions until this Page has been configured successfully. See: `s2Member -> General Options -> Membership Options Page`. If you see no warning notice after updating your options, you're good. ~ Not a huge issue, but this was catching a few newbies by surprise.
* Support for third-party integrations that need to determine the location of your Membership Options Page, without having direct access through a plugin. Third-party applications may now send a request to your site like this: `http://www.example.com/?s2member_membership_options_page=1`, and s2Member will automatically redirect that request to the real Membership Options Page that you've configured.
* Compatibility. Back in s2Member v3.0.5, the s2Member Menu panel was moved up to sit just beneath the Users menu in WordPress®. This has been reverted back down near the bottom, because other plugins tend to conflict with this approach. The application of a specific menu postition could be overridden by another plugin that loads up after s2Member is initialized; causing the s2Member menu to dissapear. This has been resolved in v3.1.
* Bug fix. s2Member was reporting `Anyone Can Register = 1` on the General Options page for WordPress®, no matter what. This was not hurting anything internally, but the display of this incorrect information in some circumstances ( depending on configuration ) was leading to confusion for site owners. This has been resolved in v3.1+.
* New feature. It is now possible to protect files that are NOT even a part of WordPress®. You can accomplish this by placing any set of files/folders inside the `/plugins/s2member-files/` directory. Then, you can configure Inline Extensions under, `s2Member -> Download Options -> Inline Extensions`. Using this technique, you can now protect ANY file, using Download Keys and Inline Extensions. For full details, see: `s2Member -> Download Options`. Note, don't be fooled by the word "Download", this feature is much more powerful than it seems at first glance. If you get confused, please write in on the forums for assistance from the community.

= 3.0.9 =
* Bug fix. Inside `/includes/s2member.js`, there was an incorrect reference to `S2MEMBER_CURRENT_USER_IS_LOGGED_IN_AS_MEMBER`. This has been changed to `S2MEMBER_CURRENT_USER_IS_LOGGED_IN`, making s2Member's File Download prompts compatible with Free Subscriber permissions at Level #0.
* Bug fix. In the new Download Keys feature, first introduced in v3.0.5, a bug was discovered. The function `s2member_encrypt()` was being used inside `s2member_file_download_key()`, instead of `s2member_xencrypt()`. Download Keys need `s2member_file_download_key()`, with xencryption, for proper hash comparison. This has been resolved in v3.0.9. Thanks to Drew Kissinger for reporting this. For further details/instructions, check your WP Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> Download Options -> Advanced`.
* Bug fix. Calls spread throughout s2Member's Framework to the function `c_ws_plugin__s2member_nocache::nocache_constants()`, have been updated to `c_ws_plugin__s2member_nocache::nocache_constants(true)`; forcing compatiblity with Quick Cache and WP Super Cache inside protected "members only" areas. The `true` argument was added to force this behavior in certain circumstances, rather than asking s2Member to continously detect it. This also optimizes s2Member's security routines.

= 3.0.8 =
* Framework updated to support a special %%modification%% Replacement Code in proxy IPN Return URLs; used by the s2Member Pro Module.

= 3.0.7 =
* Support for IPN Proxy Return URLs has been added to the s2Member Framework. This makes it possible for proxy IPN requests to receive variables back in a custom return URL. This is used by the s2Member Pro Module.

= 3.0.6 =
* Bug fix. The file `paypal-button.html` was renamed in s2Member v3.0.5, to `paypal-checkout-button.html`. The "missing file error" has been corrected in v3.0.6.

= 3.0.5 =
* s2Member v3.0.5 is the first version of s2Member that is fully compatible with the s2Member Pro Module. Available now @ [s2Member.com](http://www.s2member.com/).
* New Level #0. s2Member now supports a new reserved Level #0 for Free Subscribers. s2Member has always supported Free Subscribers, but in past versions it was not possible to set custom permissions in the s2Member configuration panels for Level #0. Now you can. See: `s2Member -> General Options -> Open Registration`. You can now set Page, Post, Tag, Category, and even URI restrictions for Level #0.
* New feature. You can now create a "demo" account for public testing. Demo accounts ( where the Username MUST be "demo" ), will NOT be allowed to change their password. This will allow you to share a demo `username` / `password` with potential Customers, without having to worry about the password for the special "demo" account being changed during a demonstration. Any other restrictions you need to impose, if any; must be done through custom programming, using s2Member's Advanced Conditionals. See `s2Member -> API Scripting -> Advanced Conditionals`.
* New filter. s2Member now provides a well-hidden feature where a developer can use a WordPress® Filter to modify the default demotion Role. In other words, instead of having Members who cancel, demoted to a Free Subscriber by the s2Member Auto-EOT System, it is now possible through custom programming to modify this using `c_ws_plugin__s2member_option_forces::force_demotion_role`.
* New feature. s2Member now supports Custom Capability Sub-directories for protected file downloads. See: `s2Member -> API Scripting -> Custom Capability Files`.
* New feature. s2Member now supports site-specific/time-sensitive and unique "Download Keys", which can be created for specific files that you've protected with s2Member. For full details, see: `s2Member -> Download Options -> Advanced Restricions`.
* Deprecated. The method `md5(s2member_xencrypt())` for protected file Keys has been deprecated; in favor of `s2member_file_download_key("location of file")`. For full details, see: `s2Member -> Download Options -> Advanced Restricions`. The older md5 method still works, but it will be removed in a future release of s2Member, so please update your site if you've been using Download Keys.
* Bug fix. When s2Member is configured to allow Custom Passwords during registration, instead of asking the User to check their email after registering, the message after registration now reads: `Registration complete. Please log in.` Since the Customer chose their own password during registration, asking them to check their email before logging in is a bit weird. This has been resolved in s2Member v3.0.5.
* Bug fix. A bug was found in two regex patterns that matched against the PayPal® `item_number` field. This was causing the registration system to fail under certain conditions, with the error: `Registration is currently not allowed`. This has been resolved in s2Member v3.0.5.
* Bug fix. Some regex patterns were being processed incorrectly by the function `preg_replace()`. This was only happening when a dollar sign was used within the second argument value. A new function has been added: `c_ws_plugin__s2member_utils_strings::esc_ds()`, which resolves the issue by escaping dollar signs before regex pattern matching is performed.
* Improvement. Improved validation routines in the PayPal® Button Generator. This helps to catch potential problems for novice/beginning site owners.
* General cleanup / attribute escaping. The function `esc_attr()` is now applied to all Shortcode processing attributes. This prevents conflicts with some plugins.
* CKEditor. It appears that the CKEditor plugin does not preserve WordPress® Shortcodes on some installations we've seen. s2Member has been updated to strip `&quot;` from Shortcode attributes, which helps to fight against this issue. That being said, we highly recommend the default WordPress® Editor. Should you install a custom Editor plugin, you may have unexpected results with WordPress® Shortcodes.
* Framework in place for additional gateways to be added in future releases of the s2Member Pro Module.
* Bug fix. A minor bug was found in a few Hooks called upon inside `menu-pages/paypal-buttons.inc.php`. These were incorrectly referencing the `options_page`. This bug was first introduced in v3.0.4 and has been corrected in v3.0.5.
* Interface. By popular demand, the background color of the Profile Modification Page has been changed from light grey, to pure white.
* Bug fix. A Special Redirection URL in the s2Member API Constant ( `S2MEMBER_LOGIN_WELCOME_PAGE_URL` ) was not being filled with possible Replacement Codes. This was only affecting the API Constant, and not the internal functionality of s2Member. None the less, this has been corrected in v3.0.5.
* API Constants. Some new API Constants have been added in support of Level #0. See: `s2Member -> API Scripting -> API Constants`.
* Positioning of the s2Member Menu panels has been moved up, so it now sits just beneath the Users menu in WordPress®.
* Bug fix. Forced type casting (int) on API Constants `S2MEMBER_CURRENT_USER_REGISTRATION_TIME` and `S2MEMBER_CURRENT_USER_REGISTRATION_DAYS`.
* Bug fix. A couple of routines using `WP_User` were not checking for the correct instantiation of the `WP_User` class. This has been corrected in v3.0.5.
* Improvement. Additional routines added to various functions in order to further optimize database queries.
* Utility function. A new function was added to `utilities.inc.php`. See: `c_ws_plugin__s2member_utils_strings::esc_dq()`.
* IPN routines cleaned up a bit. Now supports s2Member Pro/PayPal® Pro integrations - when the s2Member Pro Module is installed.
* Bug fix. IPN processing routines were sending API / Signup Notifications and creating Signup Tracking Codes whenever an account was being updated through a subscr_signup response with advanced update vars ( on0, os0 ). This was not the intended behavior. Signup Notifications and Signup Tracking Codes should only be processed ONE time for each Customer. This has now been resolved in v3.0.5.
* Bug fix. Hooks/Filters were not being given a chance inside `profile.inc.php` because s2Member was loading this on `init`, instead of through `template_redirect`. This has been resolved now in v3.0.5.
* Conditional fix. Possible Registration URL failure during IPN processing was not reporting anything in the logs. There was not much chance of this happening, but, at any rate; the log reporting mechanism has now been corrected in v3.0.5.
* Internal feature. The IPN processing routines are now capable of self-verifying proxy requests through `$_GET["s2member_paypal_proxy"]` and `$_GET["s2member_paypal_proxy_verification"]`. This is useful only for advanced site owners who are extremely familiar with s2Member. The s2Member Pro Module uses this feature.
* New Replacement Codes for Signup Confirmation Emails. These new Replacement Codes are now available: `%%initial_cycle%%`, `%%regular_cycle%%`, `%%recurring/regular_cycle%%`. These are available only for the Signup Confirmation Email; making it easier; since conditional analysis is not possible for email templates.
* FAQs updated. See: `s2Member -> s2Member Info` inside your WordPress® Dashboard.
* Changelog trimmed away at version v2.0.

= 3.0.4 =
* Over 100 new Hooks/Filters have been added to the s2Member framework. Many of these Hooks/Filters now pass variables by reference.
* All of s2Member's function calls have been wrapped inside `if(!function_exists()){}`. This gives developers the ability to override built-in functions - as needed. We suggest using Hooks/Filters, but when all else fails, you can now override built-in functions.
* IMPORTANT: ( Attention Developers ) All of s2Member's internal Hooks/Filters have been prefixed with `ws_plugin__` starting with v3.0.4. Given the number of Hooks/Filters spread throughout the s2Member framework ( now over 200 ); it was important to establish a standard for prefixing all Hooks/Filters. This will prevent future namespace clashes. If you've hooked into s2Member using your own custom programming routines, please update all of your Hooks/Filters by prefixing them with `ws_plugin__`.
* Security fix. It was possible for a Customer to use a Registration Access Link generated by s2Member; coming from a previously canceled purchased, to re-register under certain circumstances. This has been resolved in v3.0.4.

= 3.0.3 =
* Framework updated to WS-P-3.0.

= 3.0.2 =
* Feature for developers. All of s2Member's internal Hooks &amp; Filters have been updated to support `get_defined_vars()` as a single argument on Hooks, and as a secondary argument on Filters. The PHP function: `get_defined_vars()` provides plugin developers with full access to all defined variables - within the scope of a function that is calling upon Hooks/Filters.
* Bug fix. A bug was found in a regex pattern that matched against the PayPal® `item_number` field. This was causing the IPN system to fail under certain conditions. This has been resolved in s2Member v3.0.2.
* Bug fix. A bug was found in remote calls on some servers that use `zlib.output_compression`. This was affecting s2Member's ability to read data returned by `wp_remote_request()` whenever gzinflate failed on strings starting with these two bytes `\x78\x9c`.
* Framework updated to WS-P-2.3.

= 3.0.1 =
* Compatibility. The function `ws_plugin__s2member_curlpsr()` has been replaced by `c_ws_plugin__s2member_utils_urls::remote()`, which makes use of `wp_remote_request()` through the WP_Http class. This removes s2Member's absolute dependency on the cURL extension for PHP. Removing this dependency, allows s2Member/WordPress® to work out the best method of communication; based on what the installation server has available.
* Compatibility. The MailChimp® API Class has also been modified to use `c_ws_plugin__s2member_utils_urls::remote()`. In previous versions of s2Member, the MailChimp® API required `allow_url_fopen = on` because it used the fsockopen method to communicate with the MailChimp® server. Removing this dependency on fsockopen, allows s2Member/WordPress® to work out the best method of communication; based on what the installation server has available.
* Compatibility. s2Member's Auto-EOT System is no longer absolutely dependent on WP-Cron. A new option has been added that allows you to run s2Member's Auto-EOT System through a server-side Cron Job - if you wish to. This makes s2Member compatible with hosting providers that disable WP-Cron for one reason or another.
* Updated minimum requirements to WordPress® 2.9.2.
* Framework updated to WS-P-2.2.

= v3.0 - 1.0 =
* ... trimmed away at v3.0.
* Initial release, v1.0.
