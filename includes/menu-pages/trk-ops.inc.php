Your account has been approved.`</em>. Then it says: <em>`The next step is to Register a Username. Please click OK to be redirected.`</em>. After they\'ve clicked OK on this alert, and after everything ( if there is anything ) on the blank page has finished loading, they\'ll be redirected to the registration system, where they will be able to setup their Username and login for the first time.

Since the s2Member API Notifications operate silently on the back-end, in conjunction with the PayPal® IPN system, they tend to be more reliable and also more versatile.
